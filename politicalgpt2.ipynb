NAFTA, Hillary Clinton's nightmare, NAFTA. She said, \"I want to apologize. I should have never let that happen.\" She should have never let that happen. She's a very dishonest person. Clinton, very dishonest person. It's very, very dishonest. Even this good. Even this good, but they're all telling you how to run your business. How do you run a business that's going to bring you back? It's one of the reasons I like Ron DeSantis so much. He's a great guy, but NAFTA and the WTO, WTO has never been better. We won a lot of cases against the USMCA, and we're going to take it down to the bone. WTO, WTO. They're losing millions of jobs. Mexico's not happy. They're not happy. And they're very tough cases. They don't like taking the tough cases. That's why we're down to 2.5% of GDP. They're doing worse than China. They're doing better than some of our great trading partners. But they're not happy. They're unhappy. And they're hungry for something. They want a deal. They really want a deal. And they've been searching. They've been searching. And now they have a deal. It's not a good deal. Not a good deal. But think of it, we're down to 2.5% of GDP. And they want to make it 50. It's not easy, and they've been searching. And now they have a deal. It's a good deal. And hopefully it gets signed. But we're doing well. And here's the point. Because here's the point. We do better when we have a good deal. We do better when we have a good deal. Because when you have a bad deal, it takes away your energy. It takes away your spirit. It takes away your drive. That's why this country has such tremendous success. Because we're dealing with very sick and deranged people. But we're dealing with people that are sick and deranged, and they're very deranged people. There is nothing that the dirty political establishment hates more than a president that they cannot intimidate, and particularly when that president speaks out against them. They're afraid of him. They hate him. And they hate our movement. They love our movement. So if you dare to defy them, and I have pretty good examples of people, even small children, being led up to a burning building, and then shot. And there's nobody that loves our movement more than Sean Hannity. So Sean, the great Sean Hannity, I'll tell you, he's had it. He's had it. And he's got nothing but contempt for the people of Colorado. He goes up, and he says, \"What do you think of people running for president?\" And they're all like, \"I don't know.\" Some are very good looking. Some are beautiful. They're all good looking. And he says, \"What do you think of people running for president?\" And they're all like, \"I don't know.\" They don't know anything about it. He says, \"Look, they're stupid people. They're the stupid people.\" I think they're the most stupid people in this country. Hey, they're the stupid, most stupid people. You know that Sean, they're only stupid if you're doing something very bad. If you do something very bad, if you offend the people, which frankly, you shouldn't do, it's okay. It's okay. Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk about it. These people are sick.  cops love Trump, Trump loves cops. Our bold pursuit of this pro-American agenda has enraged, and you know what it's done? It's enraged the failed ruling class in Washington. Not easy to get them out, but we're doing it slowly, but surely. These corrupt politicians and the radical leftists got rich bleeding America dry. And they knew that my election would finally end their pillaging and looting of our country. And that's what they were doing. And that's what they continue to try and do. That is why, from day one, the wretched Washington swamp has been trying to nullify the results of a truly great and democratic election, the election of 2016. They're trying. They're not getting very far. They want to erase your vote like it never existed. They want to erase your voice. And they want to erase your future. But they will fail, because in America, the people rule again. Do you remember that, just 19 minutes after I raised my hand and took the oath of office, The Washington Post, a terrible newspaper that doesn't know how to write the truth, published\n"

Well, first of all, it's a very dishonest person. Next of all, it's a phony. Lastly, it's a crooked person. I'm not going to let it happen. Can't do it. Right? Well, I'm also very proud that we have successfully brought back the Big 10 and the Ohio State Buckeyes. You better have a good year after all of that. You have a good team, right? Good coach. Good team. Good everything. You have a good team. You always have a good team. But you never hear them say that anymore. Now you hear them say, \"He's bringing back the Ohio State Buckeyes.\" That's not what they were referring to. We're bringing back the Ohio State Buckeyes. The Big 10 and the Ohio State Buckeyes. We have a lot of expectations on them. I know it from experience. I was a little surprised. I never thought I'd the Buckeyes. You know what they're talking about? They were right. I was a little surprised people. But I'm delighted to report that expectations are slowly fading away. They were right. I never thought I'd the Buckeyes. You know what they're talking about? They were talking about the weather. It's terrible. It's terrible. You know what it is? It's called, like, I'm not going to mention the name Ohio. I don't think they'll let me keep it. It's like, they're going to say, \"Let's not use that name. That's a terrible name.\" But it's sort of faded away. But you know what it is? The expectations are there. The team is good.

They would say, \"Let there be a constitutional crisis.\" They would say, \"Let's try a new one.\" It's gone through the whole thing. They would have a constitutional crisis. I'm telling you. Through the whole thing, 99.9% of the time, they're right. They're right. But oftentimes they're not right, and they put pressure on the wrong people. That's why we have impeachment threats, because they know that if they don't do that, we are not going to do anything. We are so far left. That's what we're doing. I just saw Neil Gorsuch, and I'll tell you, he's a great guy, Gorsuch. They're reviewing his nomination. We have to put him over at the end of this very short period of time. We'll announce a nominee next week. We're looking at about a 25-year confirmation period. We'll announce a nominee the following week. They'll be confirmed and effective immediately. We'll follow it with another and another and another. They're going to be over a hundred. I think the most they'll do is maybe a couple of simple inquiries, but they'll find that out. How about this? They're going to make a medical doctor. You know, it's a little strange, but that's what they do. They go through the whole thing. They want to make a doctor. I don't think they have any medical doctors. I think maybe one or two. They look at the X-rays. Who would believe a thing like that? I don't know. I've never seen anything like it. Every major Democrat running for president supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the moment of birth. That is why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, and they're the party of socialism. They're the party of the 1%.

We're stopping tickets from going to drug dealers, traffickers, and violent criminals. We're stopping people from coming into our country illegally from all over the world. We don't want people coming into our country, but there's going to be a lot of them very bad people. Now, the bad ones, we're going to take care of them right now. We're going to take care of them very fast. You have to see some of the people. Some of the people that are just vicious, vicious criminals, MS-13. You know that, right? They're tough. They're ruthless. You know how long it would take me to get rid of Ted? I'd have to call him a racist. Right? A lot of the people that want to get rid of him, he's too perfect. They'd say, \"What a great president he is.\" Right? He's no president. He's a Senator. He's done a great job. But they want to stop us from even talking about him. Okay? They want to stop us. They want to stop us. They want us from even talking about him. Even though he's a rubber stamp, they won't let us have him on anything. Even though his party wants to erase your borders and turn your cities into war zones, Sanctuary City. We're stopping people from coming into our country from countries that have crime rates that are so high you wouldn't even believe it's possible, and Democrats want to drive them out like crazy. That's not happening anymore. It's happening more and more. Gang members, MS-13, they're the worst people. These are the worst people. I've been to Mexico. They have gang members. Some of them are downright vicious. And instead of giving them a shot, they want to throw them in prison. In many ways, I'd like them to go back. I think they should go back to their country. I don't know. They're probably murdered or maimed. I don't know. They're probably murdered or killed. The same people that want open borders. They want sanctuary cities. They want people that are going to come in and not be able to properly tax, so we don't have to have a lot of paperwork. It's a much easier system. It's a much easier system. But I also took the strongest ever action to confront China's massive theft of American jobs. Our strategy worked. Massive tariff and tariff money is pouring in and has poured in, poured in by the billions and billions. We never took in 25 cents from China. They ripped us so much you wouldn't believe it. Now they respect us again. Last month we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our\n",

It's called the tier two, two stories. That's what they call it. Getting down. Getting down. It's the best. It's the strongest. I'm not going to get into specifics because we're getting a subpoena on that. How about that? We're getting subpoenaed. Down the other side of the border. Down the other side of the wall. Getting down. Down. It's the best. It's the strongest. I've been to many sides. On the one hand, you have the Democrats. They're bad people. The Democrats have spent the last three years, and probably even before I came down here, but we started this, would you believe it? Do you believe it? The Democrats have a Republican party that's full of scoundrels, and you know what they're going to do? They're going to bring it out. They're going to bring it out of the basement. They're going to bring it out of the basement and into the mainstream of the media, and that's what's happened. And now the Democrats are saying, \"Let's give up. Let's give it up. Let's give it up.\" It's not going to happen, I can tell you that. It's not going to happen. I don't think the people of Utah are going to give up on us anytime soon. The people of Utah, my people are great, they love our country, right? Love our country. I know it from personal experience. I was blessed with great support from the people of Utah. I'm not going to lose Utah. I'm going to keep it. Yes. You are going to keep it. Thank you. Thank you. That's okay. They'll call us whatever they want. That's what they want to do. They want to distract from the fact that their crimes and the radical Left's go hand in hand. They corrupt our government. They're worse than Crooked Hillary Clinton, worse than Crazy Bernie, worse than all of the other Democrat's that you have heard about. The Democrat party is run by left wing extremists who want to massively raise your taxes, increase regulations, cancel your health plans, raid your social security, they will destroy your social security, eliminate religious liberty, punish free speech, confiscate your guns, abolish your borders, and indoctrinate America's children with hateful, left-wing ideology. Other than that, they want to make our cities safer and your children's birth rates significantly higher than they are right now. Not going to happen. They want to tear down symbols of faith and drive Christians from the public square. You know that. You've been reading about it for the last year. I was even accused of copying a sermon given by a leading member of the far left, Jeremy Christian. I'm the only one that he's ever referred to. I don't know if he knows I'm here. I don't know. But he's been jumping around, but he copied it. This is not the same group. I'm not going to do it. I won't do it. I have not the faintest idea what the hell they're doing up there. I mean, it's… I must tell you, I'm not a believer in either the religion or the police. But they're here for a reason. First, they were accused of trying to poison our election with anti-semitic materials. And now they're denying it ever happened. They're denying it ever happened. They said it's absolutely untrue. They said it's been debunked. 100% false. They want to erase your borders and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in schools. And they're doing it right now. Right here in Utah. Left wing politicians even want to abolish the rule of law, drive dissent underground, and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in school. That's what's happening. Even the great Tulsi Gabbard. I call her a lot of times, she's brilliant. I'd love to be her student. She's brilliant, but she's been driven from office. She was totally subverted. She's not been taken seriously by the people of Utah. She was totally subverted by people that really believe what they're saying. That's called deception. That's called the double dissention. Utahns for Trump. And we're joined tonight by a very powerful man in Washington, your great Senator. Senator Tom Cotton. Come on up, Tom. Come on up, Tom. We're going to take care of you, Tom. You're looking well. Thank you very much. We're going to take care of you, Tom. You're looking well. We're going to take care of you. They're going to take away your guns. They're going to take\n",
            "The country is far too advanced for the Obama administration to allow China to rip us off. It's not only do we not allow it, we're stopping it. We're stopping it so badly. To protect America's workers, I suspended the entry of foreign workers who threatened American jobs, and I'm now allowing all of our workers to come into the United States. Now they can stay. You know what that is? They can stay. Last month, Walmart.com, the world's largest private employer, announced plans to build a million jobs in Michigan. And that's in the small town, not the big box. That's in the small town. And it's very interesting, you know what? That means people, even in the New York Times, they say it's a wonderful development. That means a lot of people. It's a wonderful development for our country. On no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than on immigration. Every day, Democrats open border policies are harming and killing innocent lives. You know what's happening, you know what's going on. And you know what, they don't even want to talk about it. They don't want to talk about it. They want to keep it quiet, and that's what they're doing. And you know what, if you look at what's going on with MS13, if you look at what's going on with so many other gangs, even in the sanctuary jurisdiction of Los Angeles, it's sanctuary. They take the MS13 gang members and they throw them into the Pacific Ocean. And it's called the L.A. Sheriff's department. Right? It's called the L.A. Sheriff's department. The ICE officers go into the Pacific Ocean and they take them out of our country. They take them out of our country by the thousands. By the thousands. Today, the L.A. Sheriff's departmenticled a sweep and arrested nearly a 100 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder. Yet today, almost daily right-wing websites and social media personalities discuss the arrest of an illegal alien charged with murder in connection with the brutal and sadistic murders of five young women. Yet every story about the murder of innocent people is the same. The same. Yet no matter how hard they try, they will not touch, they will not touch this radical left agenda of mine. Instead, they want to protect them and they will not protect them. You see it. ICE officers are the toughest human beings, and they love our country. They're proud and they're tough people. I'm just seeing so many ICE officers, and they treat our country so good. They don't want criminals coming in. You know why? Because we're taking care of it. Take it easy. Take it easy. They're taking care of it. As President, I will always support the heroes of ICE and I will always protect American families first. Last year, ICE officers, who by the way are heroes. They're incredible. I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it. Let's see, you can do it. They take out thousands and thousands of MS13 killers a year. And then they put them back into the community where they committed more crimes than the street. How about that? We're stopping them from coming into our country. I want to thank ICE. And we're stopping them from… They took out over 100,000 MS13 killers last year alone. It's a disgrace, what they're doing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. I want to thank you all for being here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. So we begin this very, very important election season. We begin this very important election season with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for our nation's future. And by the way, we begin this campaign with the best poll numbers that we've ever had. Thank you, Joe. Thank you. Do you think we have a positive vision? I think so. We begin this campaign with the best poll numbers that we've had in the history of our country, and by the way, to be honest with you, from Kenosha to Moorhead, from Milwaukee to right here in Des Moines, thank you. This is going to be a very, very close. I don't know, faces it. It's going to be close. I think we have a good shot at winning. We know what we're doing. I think we're going to be able to win this state. I don't know, we're going to win it by a lot. We're going to win it by a lot. So Joe, Joe, thank you. Thank you. Those comments were terrible.

Under the Biden plan, insurance would go away. People would go out. They would go under. That's what it would look like, actually. That's what it would look like. I've been telling people, \"You know what? You can't let that happen.\" It's one of the reasons the economy is doing well. It's one of the reasons our country is doing well. But the Biden plan would collapse our economy. It would destroy the social security, they want to destroy it. They want to destroy it. Remember they used to say with me, \"Well, I'm going to end it.\" I said, \"Don't worry about it.\" It's now four years, 12 million. I didn't say, \"End it.\" Because I'm only kidding. I'm only kidding. I'm only kidding. They actually said, \"End it.\" I didn't say, \"End it.\" They actually said, \"We're going to raise your taxes.\" And I didn't say, \"End it.\" I meant, actually, I hope I didn't say it. I'm not sure I did. That's when I was beginning to get, I mean, it's not been that long. I mean, it's been a little bit, but it's been a little bit less then expected. You know, they say the most important thing a president can do is the budget. Do you remember that, in my first budget? Do you remember that? I actually think of this, I'm the most important thing a president can do. And by the way, the Democrats want to raise your taxes. We want to lower them. We want to make the rich pay their fair share. We want companies to move to Mexico instead of to China. We want wages to come down, inflation to come down, job creation to come down. You know, if you like your plan, that's fine, but you have to pay taxes. We want to bring our jobs back to the United States, because we need our jobs. Somebody's going to pay taxes. Not a good thing. So we're stopping China from ripping us off. We're stopping all of these other countries from taking advantage of the United States where we lose our money, we lose our wealth, we lose our jobs, we close our factories. That's not happening anymore. That's not happening anymore. The era of economic surrender is over, and it's over with. It's over. They can't get it back. You know when China came to the White House two weeks ago, they had the largest order of corn in the history of our country. Did you know that? From China, thank you very much. They weren't happy. President Obama should be pleased, but he didn't know how to do it. I did, and he wants to do it badly. But it was very slick, very smooth, right? They didn't want to do it. At first, they didn't want to do it. Then they said, \"Let's do it a little bit.\" They did it and it was good. They said, \"You're not going to like this.\" I said, \"Oh, I don't know.\" He's going to raise your taxes. He's going to open up your borders. He's going to take away your health insurance, right? He's going to destroy your social security. They're doing that. Then they're going to destroy your social security. They're going to destroy your protections for pre-existing conditions, and we will always protect your social security and your Medicare. We will always protect your social security and your Medicare. Remember they said, \" Oh, he's going to destroy your social security.\" Well, it's the other thing. Look, he's raised his hand. You know, for the first time in 51 years, he's raised his hand in favour of our vets. We're revising it. They're going to revise it. Our vets, who've been treated very badly.

I don't think so. Now these are very dishonest people. Very, very dishonest people. But I'll tell you what. The people that are strongest, most vicious, most horrible people, they're the people that got the worst press. It's called the gossip section. You know what that is? The gossip section. Remember what I used to say about people? If you're not the most horrible person, you're not going to get a great job. Now I said, \"If you're not the most horrible person, there's no way you can get a great job. There's no way.\" It's terrible, what they're doing.

It's the enemy. It's the fake news. And it's getting worse. You know what it is? The very definition of the Democrat party. You know what that is? That's what it is. The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and it's the party of the American Dream. And that's really what it is. That's what it is.

We have reduced illegal border crossings by over 60% since May, and we will soon be building many more miles a day. The wall will soon be completed. You know, it's going up rapidly. It's got a big impact. And we built some other things, but the wall is being built. It's being built. And we'll be finishing that wall very shortly. It's going up rapidly. And we have a great person in the audience who's very smart and a great guy. I want to ask him, he's taken over a big chunk of a big problem that we had. Since I took over, when I took over, illegal border crossings have dropped 60% and we have ended catch and release. That's a great thing. From the standpoint of the people we're dealing with, we have the worst numbers. We have the best numbers in the history of any administration in the history of our country. And we're not talking about the good part, the bad part, the horrible part. We have the best part. You know, what do you do if you don't have the wall? What do you do? That's what happened with the Democrats. They want the wall. They think that this is important. Democrats want a wall. Republicans want a wall. And we can build it easily. We want a wall, and it's a vital component of our national security. Just a reminder. Democrats want a wall. Republicans want a wall. And I'll tell you, if I weren't president, you would have had a different wall. You would have had a different wall. It's vital. Democrats want a wall to keep violent criminal cartels out of our country. Republicans want a wall to keep violent criminal cartels out of coming into our country. You know that. And that's the way it is. Democrats want to bring these horrible people back. I don't think they have any plans to bring them back. I mean, think of it. From an extreme leftist perspective, it's the illegal immigrants that are the problem. They want open borders. And so do I. I want to bring the bad ones back. We'll have them coming in. Democrats want open borders. And if you don't mind, so do I. I want to bring the bad ones back and we'll screen them, and we'll admit them in, and they'll be fine. But they want open borders.

If the fake protesters block all other roads, so the rioters could get to the White House, that's a problem, that's a problem. So we're trying to figure it out.

Taken down illegal crossings by over 60% since I took office. We closed it down to record numbers. We're not going to let anyone mess with us again. That's what we want. Keep Mexico out. Keep Canada out. Keep others out. It's happening. You saw the poll numbers right now. You saw the poll numbers in Wisconsin just before the election. And they were just as good. They were as good.

The unemployment rate has hit the lowest rate in half a century. The average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country. You believe that one? That's pretty amazing. That's not even close. It's pretty amazing. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels in over half a century. The unemployment rate among women has reached the lowest level in nearly two decades. And soon you're going to be seeing numbers that are unbelievable. They're going to be unbelievable. Another great thing, when I took over, that for three years, it was a record. It was a trickle. It was a trickle of people. In the previous administration, they went from being the minority, they went from being majority, they went from being the best, most wonderful people in the world, to the absolute worst. They went from being the best, most wonderful people in the world, to being the worst. African American youth unemployment has reached an all time low in recorded history. African-American poverty is that the lowest rate ever recorded. Lowest rate in recorded history. The unemployment rate for women has reached an all time low. And by the way, when I took over, it was a depression. It's now the strongest economy in the history of the State of Wisconsin. Do you remember the last election? The trumpeter. You know why it was that? Because we won Wisconsin. And we won Michigan because they were very unhappy, because their product was just disappearing. They were closing factories all over. They're closing your factories now, and they're pouring back into our country. You know, excuse me, excuse me. We're going to have a big, big day. We're going to have a big day. Beshear is too busy doing that stuff. He doesn't do anything. Even his own poll, it's been a long time since I've seen it, Bernie. But when he ran against me, in 2016, I spent almost 100 days in a battleground state, and we won that state. And we're doing well, but because of the China plague, because the China plague. So now they're coming back, and we're doing well, because we're doing well all over the country. We're doing well in Pennsylvania. We're doing well in Florida. We're doing well in Alabama. We're doing well in all these states. Joe, Joe, they're coming after you. They're very dishonest people, very, very dishonest. They don't take the time, they don't take the time. You'd think, Joe, they'd be right back there. They're right back there. I mean, it's pretty amazing. Every once in a while, we'll have a rally like this, and the people love it. They really do. It's pretty amazing, but we really, we're doing it, and it's a great honor to be in the presence of people that … You know, it's a great honor to be in the presence of the true American patriots, and that's what we have here. Is there a person up there? Yes. Up there, the room was like this. And there were thousands of people, and they had the hats, the masks, the masks. I mean, I don't know. I can't really see. I guess I have to assume that there's thousands of people in this room. I don't know. I really don't know. I just know that there are a lot of people in the room. I don't know, they're very passionate about their subject. Very passionate. And it's a great honor to be in the room. But, but only this way, you'll be proud to vote against the crooks, the crooks. Only this way. We stand on the shoulders of generations of Wisconsin Patriots, who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation.\n",

We're talking about right? So we're also joined tonight by many terrific Republican leaders. Your Michigan House Speaker, Lee Chatfield. Where's Lee? Lee, come up.

Thank you, Rob. A man who's been a friend of mine for a long time, Rob Portman. Great job. You're doing a great job. You're doing a great job, Rob. A man who's running against somebody I don't like, somebody very much, Senators Lindsay Graham, and Richard Shelby. Richard, come on. You know they're good. Richard, thank you. You're doing a great job. All of you, come on. I'll tell you one thing, we're going to win South Carolina. Richard, you don't know where I'm going tonight. I don't know. You just left Michigan, right? Great job. Thank you, Richard. A man who's been with us right from the beginning, right? Congressman Mark Meadows. Where's Mark? Mark Meadows, come on. You know, it's so easy to be nice in South Carolina. It's so easy. I could do it so easily. I could do it so easily. Mark Meadows, come on. That's a great job. Thank you, Mark. A man who's been with us right from the beginning, right? Congressman Scott Perry. Thank you, Scott. You know, it's so easy. I could do it so easily. I just say, \"Thank you very much. How are you doing Mark Meadows?\" That's the first time. He's been with us for a long time. He's been tough. Mark Meadows, come on. That's a great job. Thank you Mark. A man who's been with us right from the beginning, right? Congressman Lynn Woolsey. Thank you, Lynn. You know, it's so easy. I could do it so easily. I just say, \"Thank you very much.

And they love our Congress. So important. So important. Thank you Mark. Thank you very much. I'm just passing along some information that's been passed down from one generation to the next. Mark Meadows, come on. They're great. They love you Mark. You know, it's so easy. It's so easy. I could do it so easily. I could tell you every step of the way, right? It would take me five minutes. I could do it in 20 minutes. It's true. It's true. It's so easy. Somebody said, \"Sir, I can't believe it. I've been doing this for 45 years and I've never seen anybody so successful before.\" Sir, don't worry about it. If you don't do it right, it's not gonna happen, okay? It will not happen. Not gonna happen. Okay, Mark. Thank you Mark. And next is a man who's done an incredible job. He's really a friend of mine. He's a friend. He's a great guy, Brett Kavanaugh. And he did a phenomenal job. I tell you, the FBI, I mean, they do a phenomenal job. They really did a phenomenal job. Not the FBI, the Justice Department, the CIA. They really did a phenomenal job. Brett Kavanaugh went before Congress and he answered 15 questions. That's not bad. The FBI interviewed more than 50 people about Kavanaugh. They interviewed witnesses from both sides of the story. There was nobody that had a negative or even a smattering of people. There was nobody. The only positive, I would say, is that the Democrats ought to be more unified. The Democrats ought to stand up and say, \"Listen, we're going to have\n",
            "The group, which includes many police forces from across the state, is calling for the resignation of all 50 Republican-appointed US attorneys. They want the ouster of Eric Holder, the attorney general of the United States. They want the ouster of Loretta Lynch, the US attorney for the District of Columbia. They want the ouster of Kamala Harris, the former head of the FBI. They want the ouster of anybody that gets in their way. Look at how many there are. I mean, I don't know if anybody can do an interview like this. I know the people. I know the people very well. But we're joined today by Republican Party Chair of Michigan, Bob Paduchik. Where's Bob? Take your time, please. Thank you, Bob. Thank you. What a job you've done. What a great job you've done. I hear you're doing a good job. Look, he's been here for a long time. He's been here for a long time. Thank you. Get over here, Bob. Thank you, Bob. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Bob. Great job. You're doing a good job. By the way, are the Democrats going to vote for Sleepy Joe? They're going to vote for crazy Bernie. They're going to vote for a person that didn't do good in the debates. Can you believe it? Me neither. Neither did I. But collectively, we're doing a good job. The Democrats are going to do a great job. It's like they go out and they vote for the person they think is going to do a good job. It's like they went out and they voted for the first lady. They're going to go out and vote for their second lady. They're going to go out and they're going to vote for their grandchildren. A lot of times, the first lady is going to do a good job. She's done a great job. But collectively, we're doing a great job. It's like they go out and they vote for the person we think is going to do a good job. It's like they went out and they voted for the first lady. She did a good job, but it was her fault. I don't think it was her fault. I really think it was our fault. Go out and vote. Go out and vote. And by the way, you have some people here that are very, very left wing. They want lower taxes, regulation cuts, and more regulation. They want charter schools. They want choice. We don't want to do anything with these people. I think they want charter schools. In theory, they want to destroy the suburbs. The suburbs are the American dream. The suburbs are the American dream. And we don't want to destroy the suburbs. In my first week in office, I proudly withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal. I guarantee you this. Nothing like that has been done to the suburbs in the last three years. You know what I guarantee? Nothing like this has been done. And I'll tell you what? I guarantee you it's not going to happen. In my first week in office, I proudly withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal. I guarantee you this. Nothing like that has been done to the suburbs. Nothing like that has been done. And I'll tell you what? I'm very proud of it. And I hope you don't mind. You don't mind. I'm also very proud that we have recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And we did the same thing in Tel Aviv. And we've invested more than $2 billion in the US military, including more than $150 million for Marine Corps Air Station Yuma. Come on, give me a break. What's a lot? What's a lot? How did you do with Israel? They're great. They love Israel. They love our country. We're not going to do anything with respect to Israel. They're our friends. We're not going to do anything with respect to Israel. We're not going to do it. That's a good thing. That's a good thing. We've invested more than $2 billion in the US military. Marine Corps Air Station Yuma is now the largest military installation in the world. It's bigger than College Station Y, the Pentagon. It's bigger. I was going to say, \"Pentagon, that's a big commitment.\" It's bigger than College Station Y. They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members. My administration has also taken historic action to confront the opioid epidemic and its terrible toll, which we're very much reducing. States are leading the way with dramatic reductions in drug overdose deaths, which is a very big deal. The uninsured rate, the uninsurance rate, it's the lowest in all of America. People don't\n",

Full-time, great guy. Man, he's on line two of the New York Times now. Man. Thanks Mr. President, that's the way it is. Another one of these fake newspapers that's just a little bit controversial. I'll tell you, he's on the cover of the magazine. I mean, it's a total fake. It's a fake magazine. It's a total fake. And it's just blown up into a big, beautiful, incredible thing. What happens? It just… There's nothing you can do about it. There's nothing you can do. Economist. Do you know what it means? You have a full-time, great, great economist. He works for the Federal Reserve. Works for the Federal Reserve. And he said, \"I don't think so.\" He worked for just a short time there. I think he liked what he was doing, but he's on the wrong page. It's like Elizabeth Warren. She said, \"I'm going to prove to the people of North Carolina that slavery wasn't so bad.\" Do you think that's bad? I think it's good. Thanks, Elizabeth. Thank you. How are we doing, Elizabeth? How is our country doing? How are we doing? We're doing well. They're not good. They're not good. They're not good. I saw the first lady in about three weeks. I said, \"Let me ask you a question. Was that the longest day of your life? Was that the most exciting day?\" She said, \"No, that was the most exciting day of your life.\" I'll tell you what, it's true. It's true. We had an incredible time. We have a great governor in the great state of Nevada. Great state. And we celebrated a great victory. They've been after me for a long time. They didn't like me. And I had a great, great victory. They look like a lot of people. You know, they're activists. They're not politicians. That's why I love them. They're not politicians. But they are activists. They're not politicians, but they try and take the people that we have and they make them Democrats. It's very easy. It's very easy. And by the way, you have to go out and get them out. It's very easy. You have to do that. And you have to be politically incorrect and it's not easy, but it's true. It's true. I had a great victory. We had a great victory in North Carolina recently. We won it by close to nine points. One of the greats. And you know, usually they come right after we've won. I mean, we've won by a lot. We've won by a lot. The miners in Pennsylvania, the steel industry in Michigan, the auto industry in all of the states. You know, it's a different ball game. It was different. That's why I love it. That's why I love it. Frankly, it's much easier. Frankly, it's much easier. We pass massive tax cuts and we eliminate a lot of regulations, and by the way, we're restoring a lot of our jobs to thousands of devastated areas. We're doing that all over again. We're doing that all over again. You know, the lie the Democrats told you about your presidency. They said you couldn't do … They're right. They're right. You couldn't do it. You know, they're going to be announcing the results of an investigation that's totally disproven and ridiculous. Totally disproven. We saved millions of lives. You know, a lot of people, not all of them, but a lot of people, opioid deaths, suicides, all of the things. We're trying to get rid of it. We're trying to get rid of it. And it's just the beginning. A lot of bad things are happening. And I'll tell you, next year, if we don't have big, great, great healthcare, Medicare for our elders, they're going to destroy that. That's what's going to happen. Suicide, all forms of suicide. We are going to be talking about the opioid epidemic in a minute. But we have to talk about it because it's a big problem. And we've made a lot of progress. We have to continue that progress. And at the same time, we're stopping the virus from getting out into the open air. Out into the open air. And we've stopped it from going into countries where they don't have it. Because if they do have it, they have to have it. If they don't have it, it's not going to be here.\n",

Where's the harm? Is there any harm done? I think the word quid pro quo is the worst word. And that's why I always use the word quid. Because it's a quid pro quo. They're saying that's okay. That's what it is. That's what it is. But we're going to change it because the other word is quo. Will you please? Okay. So let me change it around? So what happens is I give her $1.5 billion. She's going to say, \"Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\" $1.5 billion. I give her nothing. I don't think I could explain that to the American public. So I'll just say, Will you please sign it? You get everything. They'll both get it. They'll both get it. So that's what it is. They're going to say I gave her nothing. I mean, who would ever believe that? Right? I give her nothing. I think it's going to be very, very interesting. It's going to be very interesting. And how does that work? You sign it, you get everything. They never even ask you to do anything. They never ask you to do anything. It's like, you're supposed to be signing a 50 year lease. You sign that, you get everything. I did that. She said, \"Thank you.\" You know what? You better make that 50 year lease. Because you're not getting anything. You know what they say now. They say the big landowners, the big farmers, they say, \"What did you give him?\" \"Nothing.

It's a denial. They want to shut down American energy. They want to destroy your suburbs. Look at what I've done for your suburbs. I created opportunity zones. Zone. Zones. You know what that is? That's when you put people into very poor areas and that's when you let them come into the suburbs. That's when you let them come into your suburbs. They can't do that anymore. They want to demolish our second amendment. They want to take away your guns. They want to change the motto of the United States to mean almost anything you want.

They say, \"Oh, the Hispanic vote.\" I hate to say it, but they're going to get us. They're going to get us. I think we're going to have a tremendous increase in the Hispanic vote. Do you think that's happening? I think the Hispanic vote is going to be decisive. I think they're going to be decisive. I'm looking at the Hispanic population. I think there's going to be a big increase. I'm also standing up for religious liberty. Joe Biden, they're trying to impose their religious views on the rest of us. Look what they're doing to the small farmer. You know, the way they're doing it is so disgusting. So, they're going to take away your land. They're going to take away your guns. They're going to be imposing their way of life. You can't let that happen. That's not happening. Religious persecution is on the rise again, and it threatens all of your fundamental rights. You know, it's not just Christians. I'm not going to mention any Christian names because they're so great, right? Just a few are here. I'm not going to mention them, because they're so great. But we have tremendous Christian and Muslim support. We have tremendous Muslim support. It's incredible. I'm just seeing it now, just out of curiosity. So, they want to take away your land.

Our wages are rising, our economy is booming, and soon it's going to be higher again. Soon it's going to be higher. And now, look, when the fake news back there starts talking about the economy, the good economy, the jobs are booming, the wages are rising, the factories are coming back, all good. You know they're coming back. I'll tell you what, we have more confidence than we have in many, many years, decades, decades.

We've done a great job with your president. In my first week in office, I proudly withdrew from the last administration's job-destroying… and this was a catastrophe. You know, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP, this would have destroyed the automobile business in our country. Now, we're taking a very hard line on the environment. We want it. We've taken a lot of heat for a long time. But I'll tell you what, the environmental catastrophe is going to be under this administration for the first time in history. And it's a catastrophe. We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that ravished our industries and devastated communities all across our land. You see the devastation being caused by China's rapid economic growth. And I came into office, and I pledged to replace NAFTA. I took a lot of heat, even from the fire department, because you know, they can't protect your factory, your home, your family, and your community. I swore to do it. We'll do it.

Everyone love Trump.\" I said, \"What's the problem?\" He said, \"You know, he's doing well with the Hispanic-Americans, but he's doing poorly with the Asian-Americans.\" He's doing poorly with the Hispanic-Americans. He's doing poorly with everybody. With women, he's doing poorly. He's doing poorly with women. He's doing poorly with men. He's doing poorly with the African-American community. He's doing poorly with the Hispanic community. He's doing poorly with the Asian community. He's doing poorly with the American Indian population. He's doing poorly with everybody. With great power comes great responsibility. With great power, comes the responsibility of being president. And I'm not just some little guy that got thrown out of the Navy and became a real star. He did a lot of things. Obamacare, Obamacare with a big fat explosion. Remember that? We're repealing it. We're going to give you your preexisting-health, preexisting. And it's gonna be great. You know, the Indian-Americans, we're going to be taking care of you. They're very unhappy. They're very unhappy. You have preexisting-health, and that's gonna happen, too. It's gonna happen. But I also want to introduce Dr. Greg Pence, who's just been fantastic. Greg is a star. He came up to me. He said, \"I'm doing well. They just gave me a plug. I hope it's okay. I hope it's okay.\" No, it's not. We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. For years, Washington politicians took money from lobbyists, factories, and corrupt special interest to ship our jobs and factories to other countries. You know that, right? They sold us out. That was my whole life. My whole life was about getting along with foreign countries, but now I have to do something. When I see the money pouring in from China, Japan, South Korea, Germany, wherever it may be, it's pouring in, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars. We're not taking anything. We're not taking anything. It's working out very nicely for a lot of countries. It's working out very nicely, actually. It's a great thing. It's a great thing. We're lowering the cost of prescription drugs, including a drug that just came out, Retzlaff. We're making it very, very hard for your drug companies to take advantage of us. They can't compete with what's happening. We're stopping the AIDS epidemic. We've done that. They've done that. They have. We're fighting the lobbyists and we're fighting the special interests. We're doing a job, and you know what? Some of you are doing a great job. Some of you\n",
            "Thank you. I appreciate it. I appreciate it. We will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to land an astronaut on Mars. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We live by the words of our national motto, \"In God we trust.\" From Greenville to Columbia and from Myrtle Beach to Hilton Head to right here in Charleston, this state is home to some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk on the face of the earth. It's true. It's true. True. We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who have crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, lay down the railroads, revolutionized industry, liberated millions from poverty, hunger and disease, liberated millions more from hunger and disease, conquered fascism and communism and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. You have the best year ever on record, right? Southeast, best year you've ever had, right? You have a great governor, you have two senators, great congressman, the greatest year you've ever had, but some people in South Carolina are getting a little tired, I'm surprised to hear this, of winning. I've very surprised to hear this. Some actually called in two great senators into a big meeting, a town hall, and they said, \"Senator Scott, Senator Lindsay Graham, we're tired of winning and South Carolina. Can't do it anymore. It's too much. It's too much. We've had years where we weren't winning, and it was okay. We couldn't get jobs. We took it easy, but we just want you to go and see your friend, the president, and we want you to represent us. We want you to say, ‘Mr. President, South Carolina is tired of winning. We don't want to win anymore. We are tired, sick, tired of winning.'\" They're going to come in and say, \"Sir, I hate to tell you, but the people of South Carolina don't want to win anymore.\" I'll say, \"Mr. Senators, let me tell you something. South Carolina does want to win. They want to win more than anybody, and we're not going to change a thing, because we're winning like never before. You know what? I don't even know how they do it? It's so easy. I mean, I have a friend from South Carolina, a great state. He said, \"Mr. President, a friend of mine from college, we were going to win together. We were going to win by so much, it's like we're going to go out and we're going to buy a lot of things. Lots of planes. Lots of ships. We're going to buy a lot of ships. And you know what? When we're finally ready, we're going to buy all of them into the White House. And vice president, so they're flying the flag, the Navy and the Air Force. We're going to be ready for business when we get into business, right? But they want to keep it that way. They want to keep it that way. That's the way it is. That's the way it is. We're going to win this. You know, we're not supposed to be…. We're not supposed to be…. And by the way, we're not supposed to be involved unless we're invited in by the people that run, unless we're invited in by the people that run, which we aren't invited in. So we're not going in unless we call it an insurrection, right? And we're not supposed to be participating unless we call it an insurrection. No reason for it. I think the public likes it much better. I think the public likes it much better when you look at it. So we're going in there. The Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Coast Guard, we're going in. We're going to be in touch with our governors. We're going to be in touch with our local law\n",
            "They could have done it in a heartbeat. You know, you're sitting there. Really? Does this place have enough? I mean, we're joined by some very terrific people and I have to say, Ohio Governor,, you know this guy? - Advertisement -\n",

            "I want to thank you very much and I want to thank you for the great job you've done. And as I wrap up, I want to say that my administration is fighting for you every single day. You know that, right? We are fighting for you. I see it. I see it. Yesterday, the United States lost one of its great, great senators. Joe Donnelly. I'll tell you, one of its greats. I'll tell you, and we're going to have a great speaker of the house tomorrow. Great job, Joe. Great. You're doing a great job. A great governor. We are replacing NAFTA with the brand new USMCA. It's coming along great. It's coming along great. And we're going to get it done fast. Get it done quickly. And we're going to get it done really quickly. And we're looking at it. It's going to be very, very soon. It's going to be very, very soon. Enjoy the ride. And a great senator for a long time, a great senator for a long time, Mike. Great job. Thank you, Mike. We love Mike. We love Mike. And a good friend of all of ours, a Kenosha native, Reince Priebus. Reince, come up. Thank you, Reince. Thank you Reince. This is such a great group of Republican people, but more importantly, it's a great group of winners. They have been so great, so they worked so hard and I just want to thank you all for being here tonight. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Together we're building the world's most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society anywhere. We're inclusive. That's why America is so great. It's so great. Through our pledge to America's workers, by the way, we're inclusive. That's why we're doing well. In my first week in office, I proudly withdrew the United States from the last administration's horrible, stupid, insane, crazy Iran nuclear deal. I immediately recognized the true capitol of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And we're making incredible progress. To bring hope to our inner cities, I instituted a historic program of employment and opportunity. We now have more than 300,000 jobs and counting. Think of that. 300,000 jobs. You know what that is? That's the definition of opportunity. Through work, determination and hard work, we've created more opportunities for over 145 million Americans now to pursue their dreams. And that's what we're doing. You know what it is? You have to say, \"How wonderful is that?\" Because we've created over 145 million new jobs since the election. So we did that. I think it was 47 million. I think it was 47. But we'll be very soon into it because we have a great, great tax cut coming down. The big break. The big break coming down. And let me just tell you something. That's a great thing. That means you're not going to have to reapply. I mean, you do it all the time. When you do it, you don't have to reapply. It's great. It's a great thing. Over the last three and a half years, we gained by nearly 500 factories and many, many more than that. We built over 125 miles of wall. Will be soon nearing 150. And our numbers now, Mexico, the wall, the wall is going up. It's going up fast. And we're doing that for a lot of other countries. Europe, the Europeans are coming in. They're coming in like there's no other. They're coming in like there's no other. I can't imagine them saying, \"How nice is that?\" Because we've achieved the most secure border in American history. We're building many, many miles a week, but we'll be soon securing that border. You're going to have to see what happens. You never know, do you? You never know. You get lucky if you're not paying for it. You know what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the Democrats. You know what I'm talking about? They want to spend 1.8 billion on the wall. It's like Nancy Pelosi. How's her doing? How's her doing? You know, all she does is work. She doesn't do anything. She's not a do nothinger. I know her well. She is a very competent person, but they want to spend 1.8 billion on a wall. I think it's disgraceful. And you\n",
            "Yes. It's true. And you know what? It's not just one, it's many, many. A lot of it's Democrat owned. The owner of the Chicago Cubs is owned by the family of a fallen police officer. And they're desperate to change that. They're desperate. We will make sure that that doesn't happen. We will make sure that doesn't happen. We will make sure that doesn't happen. Chicago, the fall of communism. I love Chicago. I love the people of Chicago. Carter, great guy. Great guy. Where's Hunter? Where's Hunter? Thank you, Hunter. Thank you. Hunter, thank you, Hunter. Thank you. They're great people. They're great. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. We will make sure that doesn't happen to our country. We don't just talk about it, we actually do something about it. Policing is a much easier job, I have to say that. Chicago, the fall of communism. And then you have the fake Mueller witch hunt. The fall of communism. And then the Mueller hoax, there's another one. The Russian Hoax, a lot of bad people out there. A lot of bad people. I think the majority of them are now very far gone. Very far gone. Well, the Mueller hoax, the Russian hoax. I didn't make that up. I don't think I did. I was talking about the Democrats and the media. And then the next day they're talking about the impeachment hoax. The Russian hoax, the Ukrainian hoax. I don't think you understand. I don't think you understand it. Crazy Nancy. Think of it. 30 years of failure. And now we're going up. Up. Up. We're going up. We're going up. And out of these crazy people, we are now a year and a half way through the year. We're doing well. Out of these crazy people. They want to impeach you. You know that. They want to impeach. They want to do it so badly. You know why? Because they know you're a puppet for the Democrats. They know it. And by the way, the millions of phone calls I get, they want to impeach me. They want to do it so badly. So they want to make up stories. As soon as it becomes politically possible, they want to do it. That's why it takes days, but even though it's politically impossible, it takes days. It takes days. Well, it's a different world. I think it's a much easier world. I think it's a much easier world to control when you have a check. I have a lot of Republican friends, and they're smart. They're witty. They're funny. Even though it's vicious, it's vicious… they're people. They're not people like Nancy Pelosi. They're not people. Oh, there's one in particular. I have to be very careful with her. I don't like her. She made a fool out of herself last night. Can you believe it? And there was nobody more foolish than her. There was nobody more foolish, and there's nobody that could have done it. She made a fool out of herself. Well, we're going to have to impeach her. How about this? So they make up a phony conversation with the Ukrainian president, who's a semi-official, semi-official with a license, a nice license. And they say, \"I need one point five million people.\" Meaning you were in Ukraine, he said. \"I'm going to take 1 million people from Ukraine.\" And they did the opposite. They took thousands of people from outside. They took thousands of people. So, they made up a totally phony conversation. And then they brought it back to me with the FBI, and frankly with most people, with most of the people that read it, they found it totally believable. It totally believable. But they didn't find it, quote, \"least credible.\" They didn't find it, that's when it was found. \"I'm going to take, like from Germany, if you can take 1 million people.\" I said, \"You can't do that. That's a hoax call.\" We've issued a travel ban on the world's most dangerous regions. We've suspended all refugee resettlement. We've closed it. They all said, \"Sir, we don't want you to close.\" I said, \"I'm afraid of what might happen.\" \"You don't know?\" \"You don't know?\" They all said, \"Don't do it. Don't do it. You'll ruin the country.\" I said, \"Don't worry about it.\" They all said, \"Don't do it. We don't want you to lose our country.\" And I was speaking before the U.S.S.R. and they were getting there. I said, \"We're going\n",
            "A former employee of a Florida auto body shop who was defending your right to keep your car has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for trying to overthrow the entire business model. You know that, right? They want to take your car. They want to take your wealth. They want to take your health. They want to take your job. They want to change the world. That's what's happening. They want to take away your wealth, to change the world. How about this? They want to take away your wealth. Not good. Former Michigan auto body shop manager, Scott Johnson, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bribery. He accepted a $1.5 million bribe to keep quiet about the corruption. And there's no limit to what they can do. I just put a 10 year prison sentence, or 25 years if you're a murder. This guy accepted a million dollars from Russia. He gave it to Russia. He gave it to China, from China. It's like, how the hell can you do it? They'd never do it. They'd never do it to a Republican. Who the hell knows? It's like, I don't know. They don't know what bribery is. You know what it is, right? It's like bribery in a small way, but much more substantial. He accepted the bribe and he walked. Nobody cares. He walked out of the factory, across the Mississippi River, and into the Republican party. That's not bribery. That's not bribery. It's the Republican party. He walked out with $1.5 million. He didn't know what the hell he was getting. He thought it was some kind of a payoff. $1.5 million, I will tell you, it's a lot. It's a lot. He thought it was some kind of a payoff. And it wasn't just any money. He thought it was a million dollars. He walked out with 1.5 million. It's like a payoff. So let's see what happens. It's a very serious thing. It's a very serious thing. It's called bribery, and it's a terrible thing. It's a terrible thing. So let's see what happens. There's nothing that they can do. There's nothing that they can do. Bribing a foreign government is against the law. And I have to say, China, I talked to them very seriously. They're a very serious player in the world of sports. They very seriously. And they have to do something. They've taken billions and billions of dollars from our country. And I just think it's very unfair. It's very unfair. I think they've taken billions and billions of dollars. I think it's very unfair. But we brought it down to like $12 or $13 billion a year ago. It was just devastated. And we have tens of billions now coming in. It's just dropped like a rock. I mean, who would believe it? Obama got rid of it. They all said, \"Oh, Obama.\" Oh, Obama. You know he's a crook. He's a corrupt politician. He gets rid of these things. Even Hillary gets rid of them. But we brought it down to like $40 billion a year ago and now it's just dropped like a rock. Sooner or later, it's going to hit the fan. We're going to hit the fan. But my biggest thing is the first rule of the NASCAR Cup race, the first rule. So, Kyle, let's go. How many did you get? Kyle, it's too early. It's like when you have your period, okay? It's like, who the hell knows. We just know that you have a period. We don't know what's going on. We don't know, do we? I think we're going to have a big percentage of the vote come in. We're going to have a big percentage. So, let's go. Kyle, let's go. Good. Good. That's great. Now, the rest of you have to go and vote. Do you understand that? That's the important thing. The rest of you have to go and vote. Because we're fighting a lot of forces that are very bad things are happening. We're fighting against the Sanders people, the left people, the corrupt Hillary people. We're fighting against the media and the gang of four. You know, they're after me too much. They're after me too much. They're after me too much. It's terrible. It's horrible. No, it's true. It's terrible. But we're doing well. You know, we have the best polls. We have the best polls. Remember last time, remember when I last had a good poll? Because you know, I'm doing well.

He was really close to 1% and he got screwed. I called him a racist. I saw him on tape. He was fond of saying, \"I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that.\" He called NATO to be with us.

This is a big day. We're joined tonight by the nation's top cyber security officials. They're great people. You know, they have my complete and total endorsement. They're great people, people that love our country, people that are going to do a great job. John Brennan, who's just fantastic. Brennan, we're going to win this. We're going to win all of our major vulnerabilities. We're working very closely with the incoming Trump administration on a bipartisan basis to ensure the public is protected and our critical infrastructure is sound. At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. What these people are doing, they will destroy our nation. They will destroy our nation. I really believe that the survival of our nation is at stake. And these are very intelligent people. I believe the survival of our nation is at stake. Because we're destroying these cyber capabilities not because we don't want to, but we've done it and it's very hard to undo. When you undo, it takes a while. It takes time to undo. But we're going to be undoing a lot of things. We're going to be undoing so many things. And you think it's easy when you have a president that doesn't have the guts to do it. You know, the first time I heard about this, I thought it was terrible. And now we're talking about, not only here, we're talking about all over the world. A very brave man, very courageous. He said, \"I'm going to be attacked by some very bad people.\" I think he's doing very well. That's true. That's a very brave man. We're fighting a very bad and dangerous enemy. And America is winning again. America is winning again like never before. Be careful with your fireworks. Look at these people. This is not the crowd of a campaign rally. This is not the crowd of a campaign rally. You know, they make these phony speeches, the fakers. And then they go to the banks of the beautiful Delaware and they start tumbling. They get one. They say, \"Hello, John James. How are you doing? John James is doing very well. John James, I'm doing well indeed.\" They talk to the camera and they make it look as bad as possible. It's the worst. It's the worst. We're winning. We're winning all over the place. We're winning in a landslide. This is the most important election we've ever had. Not even close. Not even close. I think it's the most important. Because we're going to raise your taxes. I mean, who the hell knows? I think it's the most important. We're going to raise your taxes.

Thank you very much. Very influential. We're replacing the NAFTA disaster with the US, Mexico, Canada agreement. A huge win for Kentucky farmers, for Kentucky auto workers, for Kentucky manufacturers. Unfortunately, Nancy Pelosi so far and the do nothing Democrats don't want to give Kentucky the credit that it deserves. The USMCA will lift millions of more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening all over. Look at some of the statistics that we have. Look at some of the great statistics that we have from various government agencies. The poverty line, the USDA. The USDA is doing great. Another great guy, Andy Barr, who's just retiring. And he just retired, but he was successful because he had the courage to do what everyone else would never have done. They wouldn't have been able to do it. They wouldn't have been able to do it. Andy, thank you very much. Andy, thank you. Thank you. And together we're building the world's most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society anywhere. We're a very inclusive society. In the US, over a hundred million people are now employed, the lowest rate in over 50 years. You have to be pretty darned happy, to be honest with you. You have to be pretty darned happy. And that's what we want. It's a great thing. Since my election, we've created seven million new jobs. The average unemployment rate, under my administration, listen to this, is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country. Can you believe that? The lowest unemployment rate. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels in over 50 years. The great state of Ohio is the fastest-growing region in all of American history. You've never seen anything like it. And by the way, we love Ohio. I love Ohio. I think it's the state where our family came from. It's the place where our hearts are, and it's the place where our dreams are realized. To lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most, we've created opportunity zones. Jobs and investment are now pouring into 120 newly designated opportunity zones right here in Kentucky. And Ron Johnson helped and Tim Scott of South Carolina helped with some of those. They are doing great. They are doing good. And for decades, they've been tried and failed. And in a very short period of time, they'll all be revitalized and full of life. And that's what's happening. That's happening. Opportunity zones are succeeding at a level never seen before. And as we usher in the new year, we have one goal in common. To ensure that every child is lifted up by their parents. Think of it. By the way, your parents. Your parents helped build this country. And you have a great parent in this room. Great parent. Thank you very much. Thank you. That's okay. That's going to be a long time. That's going to be a long time. We've lifted 10 million people off welfare. The Democrats don't want that. Who do you think would like to have a welfare queen as your president? I don't know. You don't know. Some people would love that. Some people wouldn't. Who wouldn't like that? I think everybody would like that. The welfare queen is back. See, they didn't fight me on it. They said, \"Let's get rid of her.\" Let's get rid of her. Nobody would even think of that. In the old days, my father would fight me. \"You can't win. You can't win. Let's get rid of her.\" \"No, Dad. I'm only kidding. I'm only kidding.\" \"No, no, no. You're right. That's only fair.\" Only fair. Because today's Democrat party is filled with hate. Just look at Joe Biden supporters on the streets screaming and shouting at peaceful Americans. Why are they doing that? Are you seeing some of the people that are there? I don't know. I think you're really doing a great job. And we can't allow that to happen. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. That swamp is bad. That swamp is bad. I had no idea it was going to be this rotten. But we're getting a lot of help from a lot of great people. A lot of great people\n",

Every major Democrat running for president supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the moment of birth. That's what's happening. That's what's happening. In the Republican Party, you know what late-term abortion is? That's the absolute antithesis of what we stand for as a nation. Right? That's why I've asked Congress to prohibit late-term abortion of babies, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Think of it. We don't want late-term abortion. You know what that is? Democrats want late-term abortion because it's just politics. It's just politics. Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. The Democrat Party also supports extreme late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the moment of birth. That's what Democrats want. It's just politics. How about this story? How about this story? You know why it's politics? Because the baby's going to die. And then the father says, \"What now?\" They don't want late-term abortion. The father wants it. He wants it because he has absolute, total, total control over the baby. And the baby's going to be Fine, whatever it is, I don't want it. I don't want it. And then the mother says, \"What about saving the baby? What about saving the baby?\" The father wants to kill the baby. He wants to rape the mother. You know that, right? He wants to rape the mother. And we'll have a situation like you've never seen before. It's not the kind of a situation that you want. It's not the kind of a situation you want. As president, I'll always stand with the heroes of our law enforcement. And I'll always stand with the men and women of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, and they're going to be taken down from every place we possibly can possibly get them. From Baltimore, to Columbus, to Dayton, and Toledo. We stand on the shoulders of true red blooded American heroes. True. We stand on the shoulders of true American heroes, and that's what you're going to get. You're going to get a lot of that in tonight's debate. We've got a lot of it. You know, you have so many countries, and you have all of a sudden, I mean, I understand. I was sort of, I can't really use the word, because we've sort of populated it with a lot of different people. But we're finally building toward Ohio. Great state. We inherit the legacy of generations of Ohio patriots, like Neal, who gave his life to defend this great nation. He's here. He's a great guy. I just want to thank you, Neal. Thank you. You're a big, big guy. I was talking about you. You're a big guy. You're the big stuff. You know, when you think of it, there's so much. When you think of it, there's so much. You've got Macedonia. You've got Greece. You've got Mexico. You've got Canada. You've got South Korea. You've got … That's a big one. I\n",

And I'm thrilled to be in North Carolina with thousands of hardworking American patriots who believe in faith, family, God, and country. Thank you. Thank you. It's a great honor to be in the great state of North Carolina. Thank you. Thank you. It's great to be in the state that I love. Thank you. And I'll tell you what, you're going to do it even better. You're going to do it better. Thank you. We're going to do it better. Look, we're working hard. We're going to do it better. You know that. We're going to do it better. You know what it is? It's a long time since we've done it. They had the worst year that they've had in 57 years. The Chinese Exclusion, what a terrible thing that was going on. It was going on when I took office. I mean, it was going on. Everybody knew it was going on. Democrats, Republicans, everybody. It was going on. It was going on in every community. It was going on in inner cities. It was going on in high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, and the worst debate performances in history. So I was very impressed by that. That was not the greatest. That was not the greatest. We did it last night. We're doing it tonight. We're doing it very well. It's a great honor to be in the state with thousands of hardworking American patriots. Thank you. Thank you. It's great to be in the state with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. Thank you, North Carolina. Thank you. It's a great honor to be in North Carolina. Thank you. I appreciate it. What's going on? You said it. Is there anything cooler than being in the room with the people that you love? Right? With all that we have going, I think you've got to say, I don't know, it's crazy. Crazy. You know what? I think you've got to give them a lot more credit than they deserve. That's what it is. You know what? We're in big numbers. We're in big numbers. You know we're in big numbers with China, with Russia, with fake news. You know what? If my people kept going in a straight line, it would have been seven fold higher. Take a look. I'll be honest with you, Sean. I love Sean. I love him on television. I think he's a great guy. But they turn the cameras around, and that's where it's going. That's when it's really going, because they know we're going to turn this around. We're going to be up to 138 miles an hour. We're doing a route that we're never done before. We're doing the thing. It's a great, great thing. It's a great thing. Huge crowds all over the place. I think the crowds are now bigger than they've ever been in the history of this country. Believe me. We're also joined tonight by some really great warriors. A man who's a great fighter pilot and a great guy, Neil Armstrong. Neil Armstrong, you know Neil Armstrong, you know. You're doing a great job, Neil. Neil Armstrong, you know. But he's a great guy, and he loves this country. He's a great, great fighter. And he is looking down with great dignity at these people for the first time. He's looking down, and he's saying things that you wouldn't even believe. And they're saying things that are unbelievable. We love these people. I just saw this guy, I don't know if anybody knows this, but he's been a friend of mine for a long time. He's a very down and dirty Senator. This guy, Rand, he's a great guy. But in the fight for freedom, there is no fight like the one we're having right now. There is no fight like the one we're having right now. I wonder why nobody called. I think we have the best fight in the world. I don't know why anybody wouldn't want to fight us. But nobody wants to fight Rand. That's because he's right. We're\n",

Mike Bloomberg said, \"I feel sorry for the children.\" That's what he said. \"I feel sorry for the children.\" I told Mike he's wrong. I think the children are great. You know what the greatest thing is, they love our country. They love our country. The great state of Iowa. We love it. For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of Iowa. Thank you.

We've already won. I like ours better. We've already won. I like it that better. You know they say they're going to have problems tomorrow. I hate to tell you this. I don't know. Have you heard? They're going to be closed. They're going to be closed. They're doing this for the negative reasons. Because you know, look, when you have a close call like in Nevada, which they have, they have a lot of closed stores, but when you have a clos... They have a lot of closed stores in Nevada, but when you have a clos... They're opening again. They're opening. It's happening. It's happening. I like it that better. We're doing well in the great state of Nevada. You know, when we had our convention, remember they said, \"No, he's not going to do well in the state of New Hampshire.\" Well, he's doing well in New Hampshire. They are very close. I think we're MUCH higher than that. I mean, it's percentage, not percentage. He's doing well, but keep in mind, it's very close. I think we're FAR higher. You know, when we had our convention, they said, \"No, he's not going to do well.\" We did well. He did well. These people are bad people. I'll tell you, when we had our convention, the big day, and they did well. There was no conspiracy. There was no Deception. There was no Deception. It was just a big day. I think we did alright. But conspiracy theorists, do you want to just sit back, relax, and watch this? And the fake news, these guys will be back. They'll be back. And they'll be back. And I'll tell you what, they're not going to be too happy about that. Because we're doing a great job. We're doing a great job. So let's play it like it is. Let's face it. This is a very dishonest media. And that's why you have a great number of people like the Nevada voters, because they're honest. They're the ones that got it right. Remember last time? 2010, they said, \"He can't get to 270.\" Remember? I came in here. I didn't know that. We had delegates from everywhere. They said, \"He can't get to\n",
            "As the nation's top prosecutor, I have to bring the highest quality evidence to court. That's what we do. And I don't have to do it, because the American people are great. I love the people of this country. Great people. And we're winning. We're winning all over the place. There's never been anything like it. Never been anything like it. But we're winning. And you know what? If Comey wins, it's not because of me. It's because you know what? We're going to get rid of him. We're going to get rid of him. So we're going to look very critically at everything that Comey has done. We're going to look at everything. I mean, Comey is a professional. He's been there for 47 years. He's been a great, great champion. He's been a champion. I don't think the people of this country would like to have me as your president. I don't think they'd like to have me. Okay? As your president, I can't say that. I can't say it. I think you have too much power over me. That's what it is. You have too much. When I have more power, I mean, when I have more power, it's because you have material. When you have material, you have material. Today, I got a call from one of the leaders of Ukraine, and he basically said, \"You're going to be hit by a bus because you're not following the money.\" That was the end of the conversation. What happens? They'll blame the Ukraine for anything. They'll do anything. They blame the Ukraine. They're a bunch of thieves. And it's about time we stopped it. We stopped it from going through our airports, through our ports, through our helipads. You know, they do a great job. But they have stopped it. Now, they don't know what's happening. I think they're just as bad today. I think they're as bad today. So, we'll see what happens. It's a terrible thing. Now, and you saw what happened, we've cancelled all future new deals with Russia. We've banned countries from which we have no business. And we've done a job. Remember that? They've done a great job. So, if you like your president, that's great. If you like your president, that's great. But you know what? If you like your opponent, that's also great. Because then you don't go to the polls, and you have a much lower approval rating. It's much lower. It's like, who is that person? Who is that person? It's a very tough day for the Democrats. I just got very lucky because two people just got elected, and they're going to be very popular. And they're going to be great, because we're doing well with Russia, with China, with Mexico. We're doing well with all of these countries. They all want to make a deal. They don't want to make a deal. They want to make a deal, and they should want to make a deal because these deals are very tough. It's the toughest deal we've ever made. The toughest deal we've ever made. But ultimately, it's going to be made good. Because all of these countries, they want to make a deal. They should want to make a deal. The Democrats should want to make a deal because the American people are sick and tired of these phony people. And you know what? The Democrats should want to make a deal because the American people are sick and tired of these phony people. Your numbers have reached the lowest levels in the history of our country. And by the way, we're doing it again bigger and bigger. And by the way, Mexico is going to be very unhappy with us if we don't win in Wisconsin. You know that. They want to make a deal. They really want to make a deal. And they should want to make a deal, because the Democrats are ripped off our great farmers. Our great farmers. Our farmers are ripped off by China, and I came and I saw Senators come and see the farmers. We'll do it quickly, but it's so disappointing. It's so disappointing. Our farmers tell me that. They want to make a deal, and they should want to make a deal. But when you look at it, what they've done, they've destroyed the American auto industry. That's what happened. That industry was really strong. Before I came, the industry was strong. When I came, it was strong. But now it's really hard. It's really hard. I mean, look at what happened to MSDNC. Look at what happened to CNN.

Remember, nobody ever talks about the man. They never talk about him. Remember Abraham Lincoln when he'd drive in circles. People wouldn't say anything nice about him. People would say, \"How wonderful,\" or, \"How wonderful.\" He would just smile and nod his head. That was true. But you know what? People don't want to talk about him anymore because he's no longer a good. He's no longer a good. Now, I have to be honest. I don't know what's going on with him. But if you remember, last time, I visited the stage right in front of an enthusiastic crowd, and they had tens of thousands of people like in 2014. We drove in like 25,000, and we left and we had tens of thousands of people outside. And then we went in and out of the arena like so many times, and then we left. And that was the end of it. No, it was an end of it. We've had rallies like this many times, and you know what? It's about building a bigger tent. You know why? Because you're going to have a big, big tent.

What do we miss, Patrick? Where is Patrick? Patrick, come up. Come on, Patrick. We miss you, Patrick. You're a good man. You're doing a great job. Do you know why?

And I can tell you one thing, America is respected again, and people are finding that out all over again. They're finding out that's not going to happen again. We will end surprise medical billing require, simple. It's one of the biggest items, one of the biggest things people don't know about. And we've taken a huge step towards doing that, all of the things that we've done. You know, I used to say all sorts of crazy stuff, that nobody would even believe is possible. You know what? I'm probably the only politician that ever said that in this room. I don't know what it is, but I'm sure it's something, that's the way they cover it. And we've totally transformed veteran's healthcare, including getting long-sought VA choice and VA accountability, which they've been trying for 40 years. All of the things that we've done for the veterans, they've been trying for 40 years. And we did it. We have a lot of people that don't like it, and we're trying to get it done. That's what we're good at. We're good at what we do. And we're good at what we say. I don't know, you know what? I don't know if you know, we spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage done by the Democrats with regard to the late, great, Honorable Klobuchar? Remember that?

And they're really doing it. They're really trying to rig the election against me. They're trying to rig the election against me. They're trying to rig the election against me. Paul, come up. Paul? I need Paul. Paul, come up here. We got a lot of people. We got a lot of people, you know that, right? They're trying to rig the election against me. They're trying to rig the election against me. I could say the same thing to you as I would to Mike. I could say the same thing to you as I would to Mike. It's so easy. It's so easy. You know, they can say all the things I say. I could say, \"You know\" anything. I'm not trying to do that. They can say anything. They can say it as many times as they want. It's really boring. Yeah, it's boring. They can say it. But you know what? You know what they don't say? They don't say the things I say. So if you want to look, there's a reason. Right? It's the same thing in Silicon Valley. A lot of bad things. A lot of bad things. But they don't say it. So if you want to look, there's a reason. A lot of bad things, a lot of bad things. But it's the same thing. They don't say it, so it means there's a double… There's a reason. Like I say in Texas, it's a big deal. No, it's a big deal. The same thing goes in every place. There's a reason. We won in Wisconsin. We won in Michigan. We won in Pennsylvania. We won in North Carolina. We won in South Carolina. We won in Florida. We won all the way in. We took back the House. People wouldn't have believed it. We took back the House. And now we have to do it again. And this is what's happening. This is what it's like. I had a great election. Nobody ever thought that I'd be successful in business. I had a great election in New Hampshire. Nobody thought it could be. And then we had fake polls. And then we had some bad polls. We have the fake polls, we have the bad polls. We take it both ways. We take it good. We don't like what's happening with the other side, and we don't like what's happening with the fake news. So we're doing well. We're doing well with the rest of the country. We're doing well with the rest of the world. Because the election's about your family. It's about your future. And it's about the life and the fate of your country. That's what it is. We're doing well, but this is bigger than it was. You had a great election. Now we have to do it again, and again, and again. And we're going to go up. We're going to go up. You know, they were saying, \"Oh, the impeachment hoax.\" This is bigger than Watergate. This is bigger than the Scranton hoax. This is a much bigger story. You had a great election. Now we have to go up and win this election. It's going to be very exciting. It's going to be very exciting. Because I'm here to negotiate. I'm negotiating with China. I'm going to India. I'm going to Russia. I'm going to many places. I'm trying to figure out how do we improve it so badly? But they said it's much bigger story. Much\n",
            "This is a big, big deal. You know what it is? After years of building up other countries, we are finally building up our country. Isn't that nice? Other countries, rich countries, they steal our jobs, they steal our talent, and we take what we steal, and some of it's our own. It's our own way. We take what we steal. And we've done that with no help from China. They don't want to do it, and I'm happy to say that we are doing much better than we were ever, ever, ever before. You know, we were swamped with China requests. We'd give them $29 billion, $28 billion, and we'd say, \"Give us $28 billion back.\" But do you remember the Democrat debate? Do you remember the debate that they had? We're dealing with China right now. Before I even said the words, \"We're going to give them $28 billion back.\" They're going \"Who's going to do it?\" I said, \"You bet. Who's going to do it?\" They said, \"We're going to give it to our farmers.\" Our farmers are really our farmers. It's not fair. China's taken billions of dollars. They've ruined our relationships with all these countries. Europe is worse, and I will say, they've made our relationships with Europe much worse. And, you know what? They've made our relationships with Japan much worse. I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Abe. They've taken billions of dollars, and it's not been me many years ago, okay? It's been a long time. They've taken billions of dollars and made them very unhappy. And, you know what they've done? They've made the relationship very, very unhappy. So, we're keeping that going very well. And, you know what? Hopefully it'll stay that way. I hope it'll stay that way. And, they've taken billions of dollars from us. From now on, when we take billions of dollars out of China, or out of the EU, or when we do business with China, or when we do business with Japan, or when we do business with Korea, or when we do business with India, or when we do business with any place, we have to account for the cost. We have to account for the cost. These guys know very well. They've taken billions of dollars out of our country. I mean, if you took a look, even at the small farmers, you looked at the small farmers, they were badly affected. They took a lot of the money and they ran, they were very unhappy people, in some cases, into politics. They'd go from being a very unhappy person, to a very happy person, and they're doing well. That's because we've ended the war on American energy. The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. And for all of these crazy people, and they're serious, people, scientists, technicians, they don't believe it can be done by anybody but the United States. We're also now a net exporter of energy. What that is, is that energy that was just plowed straight into the heart of the United States. That's what it is. What it is. When you think of it, it's not so much, as you think. It's not so much. I mean, how many lives are being lost? How many people? How many? It's like a catastrophe. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. We've done a job. And now, obviously, we're doing it again. We're doing it rapidly. We're doing it quickly. And we're expanding our nuclear arsenal. That's a good sign. We haven't used up our nuclear weapons. Nobody's ever seen anything like the way we've been treated lately by a lot of other countries. They respect us now, and that's great. We need to be respected again. We're living through the worst times in the history of our country. We're living through the worst times, and we will never, ever recover from it. But, we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to land an astronaut on Mars. We'll defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And, we live by the words of our national motto, \"In God we trust\n",
            "He's a great guy. I don't know what it is, but I'm going to soon find out. You know what it is, right? We're in the process of selecting, and we're going to be selecting a tremendous number of judges to fill those two critical Supreme Court vacancies. The last time, this was a tough one. Because the last time, we had a lot of people for the two critical Supreme Court slots, and we filled them very quickly. We have a lot of people, a lot of great people, and we'll be filling them very soon. I hope you're going to be hearing from me someplace tonight, because I don't usually like talking about places that don't have a lot of people. But I hope you're going to be hearing from me someplace. Because I don't know if you can ever fill those two critical Supreme Court slots, which we'll be able to do very quickly. But he's done a great job, and he's a very respected judge, Neil Gorsuch. Neil. Thank you, Neil. Thank you. What a job, and he's become a really good friend of mine. I want to also bring back our Pennsylvania Party Chairman. He was very, very popular. Michael A. Pollak. Michael. Thank you, Michael. Thank you, Michael. How do you do, Michael? That's so nice. I'm just watching this incredible group of people, the Commonwealth, the people of Pennsylvania, where we had the victory in the 2016 election, and we've done it again. It's going to be very soon. It's going to be very soon. I just came by. It's going to be very soon, I'll tell you. We're all set. We've taken care of business. We've rebuilt our military, we've cut taxes, we've cut regulation, we've cut… We've taken care of business. Nobody can say that's been done, and it's been done in a way that people have never even seen before. We've rebuilt our military, we've cut taxes, we've cut regulations, and when it came time to choosing our Supreme Court justices, I had to make a decision, and it was easy. I said, \"What about Neil Gorsuch?\" Everyone said, \"Neil Gorsuch.\" I said, \"Gorsuch!\" Everyone said, \"He's got it. He's got it.\" Neil Gorsuch is a great, great judge. We just confirmed a rocket scientist, who's going to be a star. We're going to appoint our next justice of the Supreme Court. We have two great ones, but we're going to be appointing several more. That's our policy. We've confirmed more than 150 federal judges, and two great ones coming up, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Neil Gorsuch. We've confirmed two great new Supreme court justices. They're going to be very, very different to how it was, but they will be very, very different. That's going to be a big thing. They will be the difference between 42 years and life, and that's what it is. They will be the difference. They will be the difference. They can be the difference. They can be the difference. They can be the difference. They can be the difference. They can be the difference. They can be the difference. They can be the difference. They can be the difference. They can be the difference.

            "@realdonaldtrump, thank you. Andon't forget, he's running against a radical left mayor who's trying to shut down your coal, shut down your guns, and make Mexico pay for the wall. You know that. You know it. They're trying to take over the whole city. They're trying to take over! Open up your city, Rob. Open up your city. Rob, come on up. Rob, come on. They're trying to take over San Francisco. You know that, right? They're trying to take over. You know it. They're trying to take over. It's terrible. We're stopping it and it's going to stop happening very quickly. The antidote to sanctuary cities is strong borders. That's what's happening all over. In the Republican party, we believe that every American citizen, regardless of their immigration status, should be guaranteed a safe, modern, and lawful path to citizenship. We want people to come into our country, but they want to come in through merit, right? And we want people- … come in, but they want to come in through merit, right? And we want people who are going to come in and are going to love for our country, are going to respect our country, and are going to act like Americans. Very simple. Under my administration, we've reduced illegal border crossings by over 60% since May, and we're building the wall faster than ever. And every day, illegal crossings are down, but they want to come in by the thousands and millions. You understand that. Illegal crossings are down. But we want people to come in, but they want to come in through merit, right? And we want people that are going to come in and are going to love for our country, are going to respect our country. Very simple. So every day, illegal crossings are down, but they want to come in by the thousands and millions. They're down now at record numbers. We've had a down week because we like doing that. We like doing that. And next week, we're going to have a big, big week. We're going to have a big week. And everything's going to be great. You're going to have the greatest country on earth. And then the bad things are going to happen. The bad things. We've got the worst people in the world, the worst people. Mexico's terrible, but we've got to get along with Mexico. We've got to do it good. We've got to do it good. I've gotten to know President Xi of China. I like them both very much. And sorry, there's no point in continuing to have these endless wars. We've exhausted all of our other means. We've exhausted all of our other means. These wars have no bearing on the future. They don't have any bearing on the future. They're just really wasteful. We've spent $2.5 trillion in the Middle East. We've rebuilt our depleted… It was a depleted military. Now we have the newest, we have the best we've ever had. And by the way, the best we've ever had is much, much better than they thought possible. You think it's possible? We have the best in the world. That's what we have. And by the way, we have many more coming in. They're all coming in through merit. They're all coming in through merit. You know, we have people that come in and we don't allow people that aren't from the Middle East to come in. We have people that aren't from Europe to come in. They can't come in. They're stamped. They're stamped with the red star. Many are from other countries, but we can't let that happen. We've got to stop it from happening. We've got to stop it from happening at the borders. We have to stop it. Joe Biden has surrendered to his party's radical left supporters. He has no platform, and he certainly doesn't have the support of the American people. Just in passing, I'll say this. When we lose… look, we're in a constant fight with the Democrats. They're much tougher than them. The Democrats, they don't care about guns. We do, and you know that. They're much tougher. They don't care about religion. You know that, right? They don't care about religion. These people are so bad. We have a great shot of religion. We have a great shot. But every time we lose, they get angry. They say, \"Why don't they just fly over there?\" That's easy. That's easy. \"Why don't they just fly over? Isn't this dangerous?\" Isn't this a little dangerous, though? They can easily mistake our goodwill for their own personal gain. That's what they do. They want to disarm law abiding citizens and dismantle our military. They want to dismantle our police forces,\n",
            "But this is the one. I was going to say the USMCA. Mexico's not exactly happy about that. They want to have that, the USMCA is a great deal for both countries. It's a great deal and it's a very positive deal for our country. The deal was really in trouble. We have bad agreements. We had agreements against our country that were very bad. Now, if you like your doctor, you can go out. If you like your doctor, you can go out and get it. It's really something. It's a great deal. It's a great deal. We're also very proud that we have successfully brought back the Big 10 and the Ohio State Buckeyes. You better have a good year after all of that. You have a good team, right? Good coach. Good team. Good everything. You have a good team. You always have a good team. But there was a case, they wanted to have a good team. You know what the good news is? You have a good team. We're ready to go. We're ready to go. You have a good team. They're ready? They're ready to go. I don't know. They're ready to go. That's what they want. They want to have a good team. We're ready. They're ready. Ready? I can tell you. They go out and they buy the best equipment and they prepare for the season. They're ready. Ready? I can tell you. We're ready. I just left Michigan and we've already begun the season. We have a wonderful place in Southwest Florida. Fantastic. Fantastic. I think in a couple of weeks they'll announce it. We're ready. I think the time will come soon. You know, they've been trying to get it for 52 years. They haven't been able to get it. They haven't been able to get it. So we were ready. We were ready. Now we have the right. The courts can be appealed. It's called. And we have the most secure border we've ever had by far. We have a very, very strong border. And our numbers now are through the roof. You see it. You see it. We have a great, we love it and we love that it's called the United States. Mexico's through the roof. They've never had anything like it. They've never seen anything like it. You know, they're always saying, \"Oh, the wall.\" First time they heard about it. They hadn't heard of it. Then they saw the wall and they said, \"Wow. What's that?\" And they went from, \"Oh, the wall, the wall.\" Second time they've heard about it. They had all their doctors. All their dentists. All their doctors. We have a great doctor. He's a great doctor. We have a great doctor. Guyantey, you know that. It's a different kind of a doctor. He'll talk about the wall all afternoon. Come on, tell me. But we have a great wall. And it's secured. It's wired for every single thing. It's like this. For example, you take a look at the desert. You take a look at the rainforest. You take a look at all of the different kinds of trees. You have wire mesh. That's the kind of a wall that goes up. It's like the ceiling of a gymnasium. It's incredible. It's the kind of a wall that goes up. It's like the ceiling of a gymnasium. It's incredible. And it's really effective. You'll see numbers coming out of this wall. You never saw anything like it. It's an incredible wall. And it's fireproof. It's galvanized. They don't want to talk about galvanized because you'll see numbers. On Monday night, the New York Times carried a front-page story about a meeting between President Trump and the leaders of the rioters in Chicago. The fake news media didn't cover the story. They don't even want to talk about it. They don't want to talk about it. They know it's bad. And the president said, \"We're not going to go.\" He's very strong. And the media is worse than those countries. I will tell you that. They're worse than China, and much worse than Russia. But don't worry. We're not going to go. We're not leaving. We're not going to Canada. Mexico, we're not leaving. These people are crazy. That's the fake news. Do you see what's happening? We're replacing the NAFTA disaster, which was a disaster, NAFTA, with the USMCA. That's going to be very big. The USMCA is a massive victory for farmers, ranchers, workers, and everybody else. It's huge. Huge victory. We're also fighting the horrible scourge\n",

I like ours better. We've already won it. I like it that better. You know they say they're going to have a lot of problems tomorrow. I hate to tell you this. I don't know if they have any reports back here. I hear the same thing happening all over. I hear their computers are all messed up. They're not going to be able to do their job. They're not going to be able to do their job. They'll say, \"Just watch.\" They'll say, \"Just watch.\" They'll say, \"Just watch.\" They'll say, \"Just watch.\" They'll say, \"Just watch.\" They'll say, \"Just watch.\" They'll say, \"Just watch.\" They'll say, \"Just watch.\" They'll say, \"Just watch.\" They'll say, \"Just watch.\" They'll say, \"Just watch.\" They'll say, \"Just watch.\" They'll say, \"Just watch.\" They'll say, \"Just watch.\" They'll say, \"Just watch.\" They'll say, \"Just watch.\" They'll say, \"Just watch.\" They'll say, \"Just watch.\" They'll say, \"Just watch.\" They'll say, \"Just watch.\" They'll say, \"Just watch.\" They're going to say that we're totally ruined. We are totally ruined. And we will never, ever return to the days of glory. And that's because of the people that work so hard. You know, when I used to say, \"Let's go to Mars,\" we actually went to Mars. When I was here, you know, we were barely scraping by. We were barely scraping by. There were a lot of Russian and a lot of other people. I don't think you have any space programs. You have federal programs. There's nothing like NASA. And so, they said, \"What the hell kind of a president is going to let that kind of a program go?\" And I said, \"You bet your money that there's no way.\" They're going to have to very quickly return to the old ways. You understand that? There's nothing like NASA. We spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage done by the Democrats and restoring our prosperity. We have rebuilt our military like never before. You know, when I first got in, their policy was to defund, delay, defund. They would. I mean, come on. Take a look at what we've done. And then they said, \"He's going to lose.\" I won. I think we're going to have a new president soon. Be careful. Be very careful. I don't want to knock the hell out of the new president, but I do want to say, Be careful. They're going to be very nasty people. They're going to be very nasty. And you know, the one time I ever saw a good guy with a gun, he was standing there, but they don't talk about him with those guns. They don't talk about guns. Come on. Let's the good guys fight. Let's the good guys fight. We're going to do this. And they want to take away your guns. No thank you. So we did that. They want to change the definition of treason. Now, under the Obama administration, the most they ever did was two sentences. That's okay. Two sentences you can get. I said, \"Do me a favor. The word treason\" is the single most powerful word. \"Do you think Trump is smart? I think so.\" \"Do you think he's going to be able to do what we did?\" \"I think so.\" So, they're changing the word. \"Treason\" is the single most powerful word. \"Do you think Trump is smart?\" \"I think so.\" \"Do you think he's going to be able to do what we did?\" \"I think so.\" And they want to change the word. \"Make America great again.\" And then they want to call your President a racist. They want to say that President Trump is racist. And that's the way it is. President Trump is racist. Because they want to erase your borders and indoctrinate your children. They want to erase your borders and indoctrinate your children. They want to indoctrinate your government.\n",
            "This is a big deal. You know what it is? I call it the New York Stock Exchange. It's the biggest stock exchange in the world. And every stock is listed. It's crazy. So I call it the NASDAQ. We are setting records every time it comes. We have records. Traders visit our website. They read our website. They quote numbers that nobody will ever see. It's crazy. It's crazy. Traders come from all over the world. They quote our website. \"This will be a very short evening for Donald Trump.\" They've been there for many years. They've been there for 40 years. \"This will be a very short evening for Donald Trump.\" And now it's been a while since President Trump has a stock. Usually it's been a while since 2026, hasn't it? It's been a while. Think of it. We've set 144 records on the stock market. 144 records. It's the stock market. Think of it. I just set a record for the stock market. Think of it. I just set a record for the stock market. Think of it. I'm just doing it for you. A record number of records have been set. Record, right? Record. I'm just making a lot of stock market records look like a lot of crap. Get used to it, because if you do, you don't pay taxes. You know? I really believe it. It's really a great thing. Really, I mean, if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020. We have to. And by the way, forget about those little twigs. You eat them. They'll be taking them down from Florida. Or from Texas. Or from wherever you are. You can't touch them. They're too strong. They're too strong. You can't touch them. They're too strong. They'll be taking them down from wherever the hell they come from. We'll be replacing the NAFTA catastrophe with the US, Mexico, Canada agreement. And we will also be revising the disastrous Washington policy of mutual destruction. That's what it is. They want to make a deal so badly. I don't think they're going to do it, but USMCA, we're going to be signing a lot of other deals as we go along. Japan, we're signing a lot of other deals as we go along. South Korea, we're signing a lot of other deals as we go along. And we'll be watching very closely. They want to make a deal. Let's see what happens. But that's all you hear about. They want to make a deal. They have to make a deal. They have to make a deal. And it's not only China. It's many other countries. It's India, it's Mexico, it's Brazil. But USMCA is a much bigger deal. It's a much bigger deal. And it's a great deal. But we do have some big decisions to make. USMCA. Who's going to benefit? You know? I think that's obvious. Who's going to benefit? The farmers. Who's going to benefit? Everybody benefits. The farmers, everybody. Last week you learned about a very big deal. That amazing, huge deal with China, and it's under investigation. And it's being investigated by the FBI and other people. But they know so little. They know so little about it. And it probably, I think probably, will be found to be totally unnecessary and totally unnecessary. China will be buying much more from the US now. We're going to increase the price of prescription drugs very substantially, starting in 2018. We're going to significantly raise the retirement age for those with 401ks. We're going to substantially raise the stock of capital stock, starting in 2018. And we're going to do a great job of it, not only with China, but with many other countries also. We're going to do a great job. We're going to do a great job. And we have many other things in the works, like to say, \"Let's impeach President Trump. Let's impeach him for making a perfect phone call. Let's impeach him for saying falsely that there was no collusion. Let's impeach him for whatever the hell it is that he said. Let's impeach him.\" It's a total hoax. Totally phony deal. And you know what? It's fueling the far left's dangerous witch hunts. The radical left's new internet darling, Kamala, who at 17. And she has a history of launching vicious, violent racist attacks, even going as far as to threaten, abuse, and destroy a man who she falsely accused of abusing her son. He was innocent. He was innocent. Kamala. She was going to say, \"I got him. I love him. He's\n",

And a lot of people aren't even into politics. They just want a job. They want a hand with the deal, right? They want a hand. I see that deal. We signed it. It's all done. It's all signed. Larry Ellison, it's all done. Larry, come on. Larry, come on. And a lot of people aren't even into politics. They just want a job. They want a hand. Can you imagine if this group of people didn't come in, and we had crowds that were unbelievable? It's hard to see. I mean, I can't really see, I'm taking this massive … I'm telling you, it's like six-thousand people. It's like much more than that. It's a much more important group of people. So we just turned this deal around. Larry, come on. Larry Ellison, come on. And a lot of people aren't even into politics. They just want a job. They want a hand. They want to help, and that's really what we need is help from people like you. We need your help. Please understand when you say help, it's like you're talking about my father. He was tough. He was great. And they said, \"How are you, sir? How are you?\" I look at him, I say, \"Thank you, Daddy. Thank you.\" I want to take care of my people. I'm sorry. I had to close it up. I had to close it up. I was shutting it up. Everybody would come in to see me. Look at these crowds. But they're great people, tough people, great people. And they've never had anything like this. They love our country. And to be honest, they don't like Donald Trump. And when I close my campaign, I just hope it's a little bit different, because otherwise it's going to be very depressing really. Because we're going to win. We're going to win. We're going to win. We're going to win. Because this stuff is so complex. But I'll tell you, so Donald Trump, there was nobody that could have done even close to what I did. They're very vicious people. The head of the Republican party, he's not too popular, Roger Wicker. Right? Great guy. Roger. And the RNC finance chairman, he's not too popular. Mike McDonald. Mike. Come on, give me a hand. Come on. We don't have any hands. No, but the guy raises his hand. It's like the Academy Awards. We're not going to do that. That's not what we're doing. So that's us. The RNC finance chairman. Thank you, Mike. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mike. Great. We've defeated the Democrats on Russia, Russia, Russia. I mean, how about this? How about this? They had a debate the other day with a very, very special guest, Secretary Of State, John Kerry. Did you see that? I was watching the debate, and I was struck by how well he was doing against President Trump. And that's what we're looking for. We're looking for that. Russia, Russia, Russia. I don't even know who the hell he is. I've never even heard of him. Where's he? Where's John Kerry? Where's John Kerry? Stand up, John. John, I want you up. I want you up. Put your hand on your heart. We love you, John. We love you, John. You're a friend of mine. We missed you. But seriously, they were saying about, who's going to beat Trump? And then we got hit by the real estate developers, because they don't like Trump. They don't like Trump. These are really great people. You know? I have a friend, a very respected person in the industry.\n",
            "Kanye is a very successful, he's on a roll, he's on a roll. That's great. Thank you very much. Thank you. He's on a roll. I hope he doesn't take a tumble. I hope he doesn't take a tumble. I don't want the trolls on my side. I want the trolls on his side. Because we're going to keep them away. The trolls, they're a troll or two trolled… I call them a troll and I call them a twitter. Twitter. I call them anything you want to call them. They're nothing, they're nothing. It's the mainstream media. They're the fake media. You're the mainstream media. They're the fake media. You wake up every morning. You see the headlines. \"THE PRESSURE IS ON TO-.\" Then they turn the cameras around, right? They never do. Turn them around. They never do. They never do. They never do it. You know why? Because they don't want to be bothered. They think it's better for them. They think it's better for them. They think it's better for them. Hello, John Heilemann. John, this is a great guy. Heila Harris. She's a tough cookie. Sheila Harris. Thank you, John. I hope you don't mind. Heila Harris. That's all right. This is a great group of people. Thank you, John. This is a great group of people. You're with the great state of Nevada. You love Nevada. You're with the great state of Nevada. Thank you. That's great. I'm just seeing that everybody's calling in a certain way, they're all calling in different ways. It's like a big tent. Everybody's in their little groups. I think it's great. You're all in your little groups. It's great. I'm just seeing that, and I think that helps a lot too. Because you know what? If one wants to leave, they can leave. It's like, \"Let's go home. We're tired of this stuff.\" I don't think so. So we're going to win Nevada, and we're going to win four more years in the White House. And then we're going to leave. We're going to leave this beautiful, great, beautiful state behind. And we're going to do a real great job, and that's what we're doing. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Let's do a real good job. Democrats stand for crime, corruption, and chaos. Republicans stand for law, order, and justice. It's true. It's true. We believe Nevada should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. My administration has already protected 100,000 Nevada law enforcement officers, and we will continue to do so. I just left Mexico City, and we're doing it well. We're building a lot of wall. You've heard about the wall. We're building a lot of wall. And we want to thank the country of Mexico. They've been great. We need a lot of wall. We want to thank the president of Mexico. We need a lot of wall. If we don't have wall, we're not going to have the strength of our country. If you want to protect your family, you can keep your family, and you can bring your family along, and wherever you are, you are welcome. And we have 287,000 people that are waiting in line, and they wait in line for four days. It's a horrible thing is happening, and we're going to reverse it. We're going to give you free healthcare. We are going to give you free education. We are going to give you more than this. I'm only kidding. I'm only kidding. They're kidding. I'm only kidding. We'll make healthcare better and safer. We will defend privacy. We will defend free speech, free assembly, and we will uphold religious liberty. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens. We will keep America out of endless foreign wars. And we will build up our military like it has never been rebuilt before. We will maintain America's unrivaled might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, which I've already signed into law. And I've already pulled the United States out of the horrible, costly, one-sided Paris Climate Accord. Price transparency is going to be very big. It's bigger than healthcare, probably bigger than anything. I've already said, can you imagine if we didn't do price transparency, and you know, there's a lot of money behind this, right? A lot of money. We will strongly protect patients with preexisting conditions, and we will protect your preexisting physicians and your great surgeons. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States\n",
            "I don't know what happened up there, but I'm pretty sure that didn't work out too well. I think the fire was pretty much out of the trees. A place was destroyed. It was totally destroyed. I think the city was almost completely destroyed. And they sprayed with water, and they did a fairly quick job, I should add, and the water's been used on some other places, but we're going to continue spraying with water. We're going to continue spraying with water. So California's doing well. Our air and our water are cleaner now than they've been in 26 years. We have a lot of regulates being sprayed with water. So not only is it cleaner, it's much easier to see. You look much better, except when it's raining and it's windy. We have a tremendous flooding problem in San Francisco. They take it away from us, like in New York. What happens is when the world meets in a lake, it meets there. It's pretty good. It's pretty good. It's going to be very tough for them to do that. But we want to do it anyway. We want to do it anyway. So it rains and it floods. We got into a lake. We took it away from the big lake, the big lake. It was pretty good, but we're doing it anyway. We're stopping it from going into the ocean. We're stopping it from going into the ocean. It's going to be very hard for them to do that. Probably impossible. But they want to spend $100 billion to clean up a lake. Where's the money going? Where's the money going? Look at the toilets. I thought we left the toilet seat back there. That's the only good thing. We spent much less money than China was paying for the lake. And we spent a lot less money. I thought I was supposed to clean up the lake, not us. I was actually told that. But we spent a lot less money and it was a much safer trip for us, the soldiers, the sailors, the Marines, the Coast Guard. It was safer. But I don't think they want to spend any money on that. I think they want to leave that to our farmers. Our farmers will be successful, just so you know. In the fall, we'll announce the winners and the runners-up and the things that we're going to do in between. And we'll choose the country that's most successful and that's our choice. But we'll announce, in no particular order, the winners and the runners-ups. And we'll announce the winner and the loser. You picked the winner. You picked the winner. Doing well is not only good for the economy, it's good for our country. We've done so well. We've done so well. And we will choose a safe and effective method of delivery, which we're going to do very soon, by the way, just quickly. You've heard about it for two months, right? It's called the delayed. You know, we're trying to get it approved. And it's going to be very, very soon. And it's like, look at what happened to you with the VA. You can't fire them. They take care of our vets. They took care of my vets. They don't let them go. They can't fire them. So we're stopping it from going into the wild. We're managing it very well. But we're getting it done. And now, if you look at what's happening with all of the problems, they don't want to even talk about it. They don't want to talk about it. Look at what's happening with VA. They don't want to talk about it. If you look at what's happened with California, they don't want to talk about it. They don't want to talk about it. And they shouldn't, because what they're doing is a disgrace. What they're doing is a disgrace. SCAM. Everyone knows about Scam. They just didn't know how bad it is. And it's being led by people that don't know what they're doing. People that don't know what they're doing. So I've just been watching the other night, and they say, \"What's the worst that can happen?\" I mean, there's a lot of things that can happen. You know, when you have a vacancy, you say, \"Sir, would you like to go to Florida? It's filled up.\" \"Yes, I'm good. What are you going to do, send me back?\" \"No, sir. Go to Georgia.\" I'll be talking about the economy. No, they're going to be talking about our great economy. They're going to be talking about our great vets. They're going to be talking about all of the things. We're doing so well. We're doing so well. And our numbers are higher than they\n",
            "In the last presidential election, the far left's effort to destroy American democracy and overturn the last election has never been more potent or effective. You know that, you've been suffering for four years. They've never had anything like this. We call it Trump derangement syndrome. They think it's going to be very, very dull to do this and very easy to just say, \"See, I don't like it.\" They want to erase your borders, reduce your taxes, increase regulations, cancel your health plans, raid your social security, abolish your Second Amendment, and if you like Kellyanne Conway, abolish all of her social security. Cancel her. Her, \"Kellyanne, abolish your Second Amendment.\" Social security is going to be obliterated. Who would think that? Oh, that would be so easy. Just say, \"Okay, let's cancel it.\" Celebrate. Celebrate. After 20 plus years of devastating defense cuts and countless scandals, China's become one of the greatest economic powers in the world. We've rebuilt our military, we're doing a great job, and I will tell you, $2.5 trillion dollars, that's not too bad, right? Not too bad. Paying interest. How about interest? Interest is okay. They don't mind. They like it. Pay interest. Should be nice. Interested. That's the way it is. Should be nice. With Republicans in Congress, we passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. We eliminated the most job destroying regulations in the history of our country. We ended the war on American energy. We're now the largest energy producer in the world, bigger than Russia, bigger than Saudi Arabia. And we ended the war on beautiful clean coal. I announced the withdrawal of the United States from the horrible, costly, one-sided Paris Climate Accord. Ask them how they're doing in Paris with it. Not too good. I canceled the so called Clean Power Plan, and repealed Obama's federal coal moratorium. We're putting our great miners back to work. On trade, we're starting to set records every week, we're reversing decades of Washington disloyalty, stupidity, and corruption. Past administrations did nothing as China looted our factories, and stole up to $500 billion of American dollars. By the way, people can't even believe it. Not 500 million. That's a lot. If you lost 500 million, that's a lot. I thought that was another typo. $500 billion they would take a year from us. We rebuilt China. And I give them a lot of credit, by the way, I give China. What I don't give credit to is Obama and past administrations beyond Obama, I don't give them credit because they let it happen. They should have never let it happen. But now we're taking in tens of billions, and billions, and billions of dollars. Just recently, very slow, Slippy Joe … Biden that is, said of China's piracy and plunder, \"They're not that bad, folks.\" He always used the word folks. I watched him today, he used the word folks. \"Hi folks. Hi. Hi, My time is up. I got to leave.\" No, they have him all freaked out because he makes a mistake every time he speaks. So I can just see these handlers, because they're handlers, like they use on horses, they're handlers, right? \"All right, get him off now. He's been up there long enough.\" So they're screaming, \"Get off, get off! Sleepy Joe, get off the stage, please. Please Joe, you're doing fine. Joe, you're doing fine.\" And then he goes, \"I love being in Ohio,\" but he was in Iowa yesterday. Yes sir. And they say, \"Dammit, he should have left sooner, we told him. Get off the stage, Sleepy Joe. Sleepy Joe, get off the damn stage.\" But he said about, Sleepy Joe, about China, \"They're not that bad, folks. They're not really competition for us. No, they're not.\" 500 billion a year, right? He did nothing in eight years, him and Obama. In fact, I'm here because of them, when you think about it. Right? Just thinking. I'm here because of them. Kellyanne Conway, stand up, Kellyanne. Stand up. Another warrior. I just saw Kellyanne. I said stand up. No, but think of it, as somebody saying that. Now look, $1.5 billion that Hunter, who got thrown out of the Navy, who had no experience, who had not anything, got a lot of money from Ukraine, but he got 1.5 billion from China, I got to tell you, I've been negotiating with China, they're very tough. China. I got to tell you, I've been negotiating with China\n",
            "You know what? I think it's a brilliant idea. And we're building it. We're building our military like you've never seen it. You've never seen anything like it. You have tanks, you have military, you have everything. You never saw anything like it. You have military, you have tanks, you have military. And we're funding for the V.A. and the V.A. is one of the very big deals, November. One of the very big deals. We've got to do it right. Because you know what? If you don't do it right, we will not have a country anymore. You won't believe how quickly things can happen. When I took over, I spent two and a half years telling the story. It was a mess. I spent two and a half years telling it. Things started happening, though. For instance, we're building Space Force. At first, we were looking for a place called Pinot. You know, the Dominican Republic. That was so much easier. We're building about 12 new facilities a month, and we'll be up to 100 by the end of next year. We're building all over the place. We're expanding our Military. Big deal. It's bigger than State. We're now building almost 500 new Military and Veterans Facilities. State buildings, community buildings, and taxpayer funded facilities. Williams, you know that. They've been begging us. Why aren't you doing this? They want to build military and Veterans. You know why? Because we're doing it for Texas. This is a great deal. It's a great deal. Well, at least you got them for a dollar. They want to spend money on other things. We want to put our money where it's supposed to be. That's why you're doing it. That's what you're doing. After years of devastating defense cuts, we have fully rebuilt the United States military. It's now stronger, more powerful, more lethal than ever before. And last year, our brave warriors launched a surprise ground invasion of ISIS-controlled territory. They did it without combat troops. They did it without planes. They did it by parachute. We were totally unprepared. They had no idea where the hell we were, as pilots we were sort of behind the enemy. We were sort of behind them. They knew we were there, but they didn't know we were there. But we did a great job. That was a shocker. We're now building many new facilities all over the place. Rescuers. First responders. We have a lot of great people here. Rescuers. I was a little surprised. You know, when you think of it, there are few people in the world that get a pass from the FEMA people, right? I thought that was a great thing. I thought that was a great thing. They do such a great job. I mean, the people here today, that's right, First Lady, a great person, great family. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. So we built it up. We built it up. They were starting to crawl. I was starting to crawl. I was starting to crawl. I had a news conference. I had a couple of other things, but I was getting ready to say something, and then the news just came. I was about to say something else, and then it wouldn't sound good. I was going to say something bad. Something really bad. But you know what? The people are unbelievable. The people are unbelievable. Tonight, we're also praying for everyone in the path of Hurricane Sally. We're out there. We're watching. We're watching. Oh, do we love the people? Do we love the people? Soosy. Soosy. Just watch. We're watching. We're watching. We're out there. We're watching. We're out there. We could be there tomorrow. We could be there in two hours. We could be there. We could be there tonight. We could be there maybe all night. We could be there all night. But we're going to be there. We're going to be there. Sally. What a beautiful name. What a beautiful name. Did you ever hear of her? She's a nasty one. Look, she spent $96 million. You know what she spent? She spent half of it. Then she said, \"Oh, I made a mistake. I'm so sorry.\" I think she's a great one. Governor, thank you. Thank you, Lisa. Thank you. We will. We will. Thank you Lisa. Thank you, Lisa. Thank you very much. A friend of mine, a friend of mine. Has anyone ever heard of Mike Bloomberg? Mini Mike.

            "We have a lot of time.\" They only have about 15 minutes. You know what they do? They go to another subject. That's the only way they can get it, but sometimes it's a subject. No, but the way they do it, it's like a quick poll. Do you agree with this? So what happens? They decide… I'm not a believer in invitations, so I can't speak to your invitation, but what happens? They decide to send out 600,000-plus invitations to all 50 states. Do you believe that? You have 600,000 people. They decide not to do it. They send out only invitations to invite. Do you believe that? They want to keep it that way. They want to keep it that way. Frankly, I'd love an invitation. I would love an invitation from your state. I don't know. Vermont. Well, we will see what happens. They're very good. They're very good. New Hampshire. Well, we'll see what happens. They're very good. You have a great governor. Chris Sununu. Chris, you have a great governor. New Mexico. Well, we'll see what happens. They're good. They're very good. You have a governor, Chris. Well, you have a great governor. You have a governor. So we're joined tonight by a very powerful man in Washington, your great Senator Mitch McConnell. Everyone knows Mitch. Everyone knows Mitch. He's been compared to Abraham Lincoln. You know that, right? To Abraham Lincoln. They say he's like a great, great senator. He's over 600 years old. So, they compare him to Abraham Lincoln. I don't know. Does he get along with the Kennedys? Does he get along with Abraham Lincoln? That's the only thing. Does he get along with Barry? Does he get along with any of the other candidates? None of them are getting along with Mitch. I don't think he likes Barry Seal. I don't think he likes anything. I think he's a racist. That's what I think. I don't think he likes me. The only reason I'm running is to stay President. And then if somebody else gets in, that's not so easy. I can't say that's easy. President Trump is doing a great job. President Trump is doing a great job. If you want to save the American dream, please vote for Mitch. Mitch. Thank you. Thank you, Mitch. We are seeing things with North Carolina. We are seeing things with Pennsylvania. We are seeing things with Texas. We're seeing a great deal with South Carolina. We're seeing a great deal with Florida. We're seeing the deal with Mexico. We're seeing the whole Lester Holt fiasco. That was a disaster. That was a terrible deal for us. That was a terrible deal. They made it up. They made it up. It's all good. You know, they make up stories. They make up stories. They will make it up. They will. I mean, it's a whole fraud. It's called disinformation. They make it up as they go along. And then they show the teleprompter manger, who is here, talking to the fake news. \"Look, we don't want to show the crowd. Nobody can see beyond the teleprompter.\" \"Okay. Now how far can we get it?\" \"Far enough, sir.\" \"How far can we get it?\" \"Sir, we can't.\" \"We can't show it. It's a little dangerous out there. Nobody's going to be watching our rallies.\" \"Okay. That's the way it is. That's the way it is.\" I think they're giving us a lot of trouble. I think the crowds are great. I think they're giving us a lot of trouble. But I'll tell you what, we're doing things that nobody's ever done before. We're setting records, every week, we set a new record. Single-handedly, through regulation cuts, we've saved more than half a million jobs. We've fired more than 50,000 people that were costing the taxpayers dearly. For the median household income, think of that. That's a big deal. That's a big deal. For the median household income, take a look at the numbers. For the entire economy, that's a big deal. That's a big deal. Here's another one. This week, more than 600 new businesses opened, adding another 47,000 jobs. So you're talking about one third of the economy. I thought that was the end of the story. I thought that was the end of the story with the jobs. I don't think so. I think the jobs are going up very big. Very big. So we're doing well. We're doing well with China. We're doing well with South Korea. We're doing well with Japan. Well, we did very well with\n",
            "The number of registered Democrats in Nevada has dropped to a record low. And that's because of our great Republican Party. We're now an Official Opposition Party. We're not going to let the Democrats take what we've done. And by the way, the Republicans, we're going to hold their own, but they've never been this unified before. You know what's going to happen. I'll tell you what, on November 3rd, they're going to be announcing their candidates. And the candidates are going to be the people that people would vote for if they had a vote. Frankly, honestly, they're going to be announcing their candidates. We're going to be announcing a lot of them. They're going to be announcing people. And your vote really is going to be deciding what's going to happen. Okay? I know you want to go out and vote. I'm sorry, that vote doesn't count. Vote counting is going to be very important. We've got to do it properly though. We've got to do it properly. We've got to do it fairly. We've done a great job with it. I'm also standing up for religious liberty. Joe Biden would be… So Joe Biden would be a disaster for all communities, not just the African American community, pledged to wage attacks on Christian businesses, or the extraordinary work they do. Look what happened with the fox. I don't know if it was a good sign or a bad sign. Either way, it's something we have to really take a hard look at. I don't think we're going to have any more Democratic members of the Nevada Supreme Court. Joe Biden would be a disaster for all communities, not just the African American community. And I'll tell you, you know what? There'll be many, many more Democrats after this one. There'll be many more. Look what happened in Paterson. There'll be many more. There'll be many more. That's what's going to happen. There'll be many more. Right? It's like a tree. You plant it. You plant it. It takes time. They want to destroy the suburbs. They want to destroy the suburb. They want to build low income projects in the suburbs. They want to build projects. I don't think that's happening. It's happening. There's tremendous potential for this country, not only in Nevada, but also in all of the states. Potential. We've added more than 125,000 new jobs since the election. Nobody would have thought that was possible. Potential. Now, under the previous two administrations, we have lost 60,000 factories. I thought that was a typo. I said, \"How the hell can you lose 60,000?\" It turned out to be right. It was right. And I want to thank our great new vice president, Mike Pence, for being with us all the way. They've been incredible. They've been incredible. Without them, this would not be happening. Without them, it would not be happening. I want to thank you all very much. It's been incredible. It's great to be with the great people of Pennsylvania. Hey. It's been incredible. It's great to be with the people of North Carolina. Hey. It's been incredible. It's great to be with the great people of Ohio. Hey. It's been incredible. It's great to be with the people of Florida. Hey. It's been incredible. It's great to be with the great people of Michigan. No, it's true. It's true. It's incredible. It's an incredible time for this country. It's an incredible time. When you look at what's happening with so many other things, it's incredible. It's an incredible time. Who would have thought that with all of the problems we have, we would have 20, 25% more wealth, not less, with China. It would have been so bad. They would have stopped it very quickly. They would have been so bad. To lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most, we've created opportunity zones. Jobs and investment are now pouring into nearly 170 newly designated opportunity zones right here in Arizona alone. Think of it. Including Tempe, where we just opened a beautiful new auto plant. You know what that is? That's where all your jobs are. They're not going to replace that. That's where all your jobs are. I'm very proud of it. I'm very proud of it. Now, the radical left Democrats want to gut these great opportunities. They want to close them up. They want to indoctrinate your children, and we're not going to let it happen. We're not going to let it happen. We're saving your families. We're defeating the radical indoctrination of our students and adults. We're building up our military like never before.

We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We live by the words of our national motto, \"In God we trust.\" From Greenville to Columbia and from Myrtle Beach to Hilton Head to right here in Charleston, this state is home to some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk on the face of the earth. It's true. It's true. True. We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who have crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, lay down the railroads, revolutionized industry, liberated millions from poverty, hunger and disease, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. You have the best year ever on record, right? Southeast, best year you've ever had, right? You have a great governor, you have two senators, great congressman, the greatest year you've ever had, but some people in South Carolina are getting a little tired, I'm surprised to hear this, of winning. I've very surprised to hear this. Some actually called in two great senators into a big meeting, a town hall, and they said, \"Senator Scott, Senator Lindsay Graham, we're tired of winning and South Carolina. Can't do it anymore. It's too much. It's too much. We've had years where we weren't winning, and it was okay. We couldn't get jobs. We took it easy, but we just want you to go and see your friend, the president, and we want you to represent us. We want you to say, ‘Mr. President, South Carolina is tired of winning. We don't want to win anymore. We are tired, sick, tired of winning.'\" They're going to come in and say, \"Sir, I hate to tell you, but the people of South Carolina don't want to win anymore. They want to go out and vote, and they want to let their government know that they are proud, and they want to let their government know that they are ready to work, and they want to let their government know that they are ready. We are ready. Right? We are ready. I really mean that. You know, when I look at it, if our government was so successful that they could do it, right? That would be so much easier, but we're not going to take that chance away from you, and I want to take it away from them. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America safe. To protect American security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal. I maintained the worst sanctions on Iran ever, and they've only recently gotten rid of the worst. We only have ourselves to blame, in a lot of ways. That was on purpose. That was on purpose. Also with us tonight are two very fine gentlemen who have spent a lifetime helping others. One is a decorated, two-star general, Billy Graham, and the other is a decorated two-star general, William Timmons. Come on up, Bill. Thank you. And also with us, a man who's done\n",
            "In the face of relentless attack from China, our great heroes from the great state of Kentucky, we saved the American workers, and you have to do the same thing in China. Joe Biden is wholly owned and controlled by the far left. He spent the last 47 years betraying the American people. That's what you bought into when you went to college. You went to college, believe it or not, and you spent the last three, four, five years or so, going to China. I know it well. It's a very tough deal. It's a lot tougher than it used to be. You know? Back then, it was easy. It's much harder. But now it's much harder. But it's easier. But it's easier. But we made a lot of progress when we went there. We made a lot of progress, and we'll be making even greater progress in the coming months as we continue our extraordinary recovery. The last time, remember this, the economy was doing nothing. Then the plague came in, and now we're doing better. We're doing better. People don't like to talk about it. We're doing well, but we're doing well. And your state is doing well, as you know, well. You're doing well, and your whole state is doing well. I know it well. You've got a lot of people that have been hurt, have you noticed? You've got a lot of hurt people, in particular, in Kentucky. A lot of people, a lot of people that have been hurt by China, a lot of people. It's true. As the Economist said, \"The People's Republic of China has never done better in a century and a half.\" They're not happy, and they're not going to do well for long with that. That's Biden. He's running against a very strong Republican candidate, cut your taxes, remember that. Remember the things I said? We'll do away with regulations. We'll do away with this horrible, horrible China virus that we're talking about. We're going to do away with this disease that we're talking about. I don't think the country's going to be shutting it down for very long. Believe me. Doing away with it. We'll do away with it. They'll figure something else out. After three years, it will be very, very difficult for them to do that. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II, we're doing an A+ job, by the way. You've heard that, right? We're doing a great job. We're doing a great job. In all fairness, the Democrats want to do the opposite. They want to shut down the economy, and that's their pet project, but we're doing a great job. The Democrats want to gut police departments nationwide. You know that. You've been seeing it for a long time. They want to defund domestic terrorist law enforcement, which they can do. They want to destroy your Second Amendment. When you see these far left lunatics rioting in the streets, you know you have a problem. You have a problem. Look at what's going on with law enforcement. We're rebuilding our military like never before. Law enforcement is, in all fairness, we're rebuilding our military like never before. Ace Ventura, when he had the flu, could do his job. That's a good thing about the flu. Joe, Joe, Joe. Ace, come on. Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Thank you, Joe. Thank you. We want to give a big hand out. Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Thank you very much. We will end deadly sanctuary cities. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will charter our future police force, the Chicago Police Department, the Minneapolis Police Department. Those were tough. Those were tough. You want to spend a lot of money on law enforcement, and then say, \"Well, wait a minute. Should we get a charter? Should we go to a place called Chicago? Should we charter our police force?\" But these are difficult, tough decisions. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for our country. They apologized. They'd go down, \"I'm only sorry I wasn't elected president.\" You know what? We're not going to let that happen. We're not going to let it happen. We will charter police forces from Chicago to Miami, and from Miami to Seattle. And Portland. And Austin. And now we have a strong mayor in all good standing again, and we're going to get him in. We're going to get him in. Good luck. Hello, John James. John James, thank you. I love you, John. I hope you're enjoying your time. John James, come on. You know, it's been so many years since I've seen you. I've been looking forward to this question. John James, it's\n",
            "In a city that's become the epicenter of the opioid epidemic, and it's not just a little bit, the epidemic. You know where it is? In this region, in this state. It's absolutely disastrous. Where it's headed, I don't know, we'll figure it out, it's going to be very bad. We'll figure it out. Over the next four years, we'll be taking this big beautiful ship, the city of Philadelphia … I mean the whole country, the whole country will be watching this. Will you please turn off the cameras, please? We don't want any cameras. Okay? We don't want cameras. Go home. Back. Back. Back. A lot of bad things are happening that you don't even believe, but you know why? Because the fake news, they don't want their viewers to see it. That's why. Opioid, very bad things are happening, and very rapidly, they're getting better. The death toll has declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. We've saved millions of lives. We've stopped the plague from going into the rest of the United States and we've saved millions of lives. To protect the health and safety of our citizens, we awarded $100 million to improve water infrastructure in Flint, Michigan. How badly was Flint?- Where did that money come from? From the pockets of Americans who have helped build this country? We are fighting for every American mom and dad who wants to protect the water in your sink or your shower. We are fighting. We are fighting. I know it. I'm doing my job. I'm helping the police. I'm fixing up. I'm taking care of LID, right? I'm taking care of LID. Howdy Doody. I'm stopping the virus from going into the rest of the United States, and we're doing that for you. In 2018, more than two million people joined our Medicaid program, the largest single number of people in the history of our country. And for the first time, people are now using private healthcare to pay for things that they would have never, ever considered it. You know, people used to take it out of the hospitals. They put it a little bit, and it's okay. We're talking about the insane Democrats. They want to destroy your healthcare and destroy your doctor. That's not happening. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring wages and record prosperity. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assault on law enforcement. Surge federal prosecutors into high-crime communities and ban sanctuary cities. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens. We will not let them threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless foreign wars. We will end surprise medical billing. We don't want surprise. You know what happens? It's terrible. What happens? It's terrible when you have a heart attack. What happens? They'll say, \"Oh, this is a terrible thing.\" It's a common thing. Who would believe these things? You're going to die. \"Have a nice life, darling. Don't worry about nothing else.\" I said, \"Let me tell you something. The world is going to end soon. Soon as I take over, it's going to be very exciting.\" And it's not just a nice life. It's a nice life. We will maintain America's unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. It's already signed, starts on January 1st. I don't want anyone to… I know ours is a big deal. I don't want Sleepy Joe to take care of… Can you imagine? I'll be watching. \"Prices have dropped substantially all throughout the country because of price…\" And I'm the one that got it done. And he'll say, \"What did I do? How did this happen?\" And we'll further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs. We just did favored nations. We're going to come down to the lowest price anywhere in the world because we did a favored nations clause. You know what that is? We will… The drug companies don't exactly like me too much. They're spending millions of dollars on negative commercials. Please understand when you see those commercials, it means your drug prices are coming down. We will strongly protect Medicaid and Social Security, which they will give up. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions and America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will\n",
            "The man that ran against me in 2016 said in a telephone call, \"You know, we're going to do this for you.\" I said, \"What?\" But they don't say that in the mainstream media. They don't say it. And that's why I can say that. Look, healthy competition is healthy competition. If you can have that, that's a good thing. Unfortunately, the Democrats have never been more extreme. 116 members of a House committee have signed up for Bernie Sanders' government healthcare takeover bill. It's a takeover of your healthcare that would strip all of those 180,000 million great Americans of your private coverage. You want that. You got great deals. You're able to negotiate, you're able to keep your doctor, keep your area, keep everything that you wanted. Now they want to take it away. Report to an operating room when you have a cold, okay? In your local hospital. I don't think so. 180,000 million people, but I'm not going to knock it because I want Bernie to bring it right up to the end and we'll debate it the day before the election. Okay? We are saving your healthcare while Socialist Democrats are trying to take away your healthcare. Sleepy Joe has no idea what he's even … He doesn't even know what he's talking about. He's so lost. Honestly, that poor guys is so lost. They talk healthcare, and that's what they're talking about. They want to take away your healthcare, and that's what they're talking about. You know, we have a great example in Tennessee. They want to take away your healthcare, and that's what they're talking about. You know, we've had examples where they've been able to do it, and that's what they're talking about. They're proposing that they can take away your plan. They're going to take away your doctor. They're going to take away your area. They're going to take away your great doctors. They're going to take away labs and diagnostic machines. You know, they're going to take away everything. They're going to take away your plan, and that's not good. That's not good. We want people to come to the United States. They can come here, and they can come if they want. We want people to come to the United States. They can come here, and they can come if they want. We want people to come to the United States. They can come here, and they can come if they want. We want people to come to the United States. They can come from all over the world, and they can stay right here in the United States of America. We want people to come. They can come in, and they can stay right here in the United States. They can come in, and they can come if they want. We want people to come. They can come in, and they can come right here in the United States. They can come in, and they can come if they want. We want people to come. They can come in, and they can come right here in the United States. They can come in, and they can come if they want. It's like cheating, right? It's like cheating. We're going to double and triple the amount of money we take in. We're going to quadruple it. We're doing a lot of things. We're doing right now more than ever before. You know, when I was a little bit newer to this game, I used to say, \"Well, somebody's going to have to come in to do a big part of this.\" And I think now we'll have somewhere around 100,000 people. I think it's about double. It's got to have a big impact. And that's why you're going to see a big percentage of the people that come in. Because they can't do it with what we're doing right now. They can't do it. We'll double it. We'll quadruple it. We'll keep it going up. We're doing things that nobody's ever done before. And they all say, \"How do you allow this to happen?\" I have a simple answer. They say, \"Let Democrats take away your healthcare.\" We'll always protect patients with preexisting conditions. Always. We'll protect those patients with preexisting conditions, and that's what we're doing right now. We'll also protect your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you. Remember Obama? 28 times, \"You can have that plan. You can have that doctor.\" Didn't work out that way, did it? I think he was a great doctor. I think he was great. We'll always protect your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you. Remember Obama? 28 times, \"You can have that plan. You can have that doctor.\" Didn't work out that way, did it? I think\n",
            "I'm sorry. I had to do it to the Republicans. They hate to do it to the Republicans, so I had to do it to them too. These are great people. These are great people with great families. But they will be very effective in our fight against the China virus. See, we're playing a very dangerous game with China. If you want to save America, you must vote Republican. It's very simple. Simple. Since my election, over 121,000 new jobs have been created right here in Pennsylvania. We've lifted 10 million people off welfare, including 7 million off of food stamps. And that's a good thing, not a bad thing. They're working and they have great jobs and they love getting up in the morning and they're making much more money and it costs our country nothing. We make money. We don't pay taxes. We're doing great. We have everything going. We have rebuilt our military, including 60,000 new beautiful combat ships … you saw these two ships … 60,000 new beautiful combat ships. These are combat ships, not for nothing. They're very old ships, much more advanced than the ships we have now. They're much more sophisticated. They're much more deadly. They're much more lethal. So we have warships now, we have combat ships, we have battle cruisers, we have great ships, they're modern. They're modern. They're much more lethal. So we have these incredible combat ships, and they're manned and they're manned 24 hours a day. Every single one of them is manned 24 hours a day. Yes, 24 hours a day. You know, it's funny, we have these people, the Navy SEALs, the Army, the Marines, the Coast Guard, the Fire Department, they're manned 24 hours a day. These are great people. We have the greatest men and women in the world, and we have them here, and I'm going to introduce them. One of our pilots, a great guy, and I don't know if you saw this, he took a bullet. Right? He got shot and he got up. He was going to die that night. I was going to introduce him to his father. I did it the hard way, I saved a lot of people by doing it that way. But he's a great guy, a great guy. They're great people. That's going to be hard. They're going to be very tough. They're going to be very tough. They're going to be very tough. We'll be introducing our next Vets in two weeks. A great guy, Green, is going to be opening up this fall. We're going to be opening up a lot of our veterans choice programs. And we're going to be doing it so that you can have your doctor, your plan, all of the things that you want. You know, we have the best doctors, the best hospitals, the best labs in the world. And they're not accepting any of the things that we've done. You're going to see things, that's true. You're going to see things. Before, you couldn't get a doctor. We've made a lot of progress. We've made a lot of progress. We still have a lot of work to do. We've made a lot of progress, but we're getting a lot of great doctors. You're going to see things, that's true. They're going to be opening our up very shortly. And we've done a great job with it. We have created six million new jobs since the election. More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps. Since my election, the number of new businesses starting in the great state of New Hampshire has skyrocketed by almost 25%. And that's because of the China virus, not the Chinese virus. It's because of the China virus. And it's also because of the fact that you have a great governor, Chris Sununu. Chris, come on up. Chris. Hello, Chris. Where's Chris? Where is your father? Come here, Chris. Come on up. Chris, it's great to see you. My father is a great guy. He's a great, great guy. My father was very successful. He's an interesting guy. He was successful, but he's now doing something that's much more successful. He's running for another term. He's running for another term. This time it's a little bit more successful. It's a little bit more successful. They're doing a great job. It's a great honor to be with you. Thank you, Chris. Come on up. Chris, it's great to see you. My father came to my office in the oval office, which is the most important office. I mean, you have to be pretty good at this job to be able to do it.

            "This year, we saw the first national surge in drug overdose deaths in nearly 31 years. There have been no similar spikes in many parts of the country, and the state of Texas … I love Texas. I think it's a great state. You know what, on January 31st, there will be a drug overdose death. Think of that. There will be a certain amount of it. Who would think there's going to be? I don't know. I don't know there'll be, but they'll postulate that there'll be. That's what the scientific method, right? That's what the scientific method is. Now, that's what they do. And that's what they do really well. That's what they do well. In 2018, drug overdose deaths, the most at risk, fell for the first time in nearly 31 years. At the same time, overdose deaths in women decreased for the first time in nearly 31 years, and the largest decline in women's overdose deaths in over 51 years. Among African American, Hispanic American and Asian Americans, the biggest declines in excess mortality rate (the number of people that die), women. The biggest declines in excess mortality rate for women occurred in the Southeast, where drug overdose deaths for women are particularly high. That's a great region. The Southeast, they've done a great job. They've done a great job. We're also thrilled to report that life begins at conception, and that's what it's like. In the first three years of my administration, we lifted 6.6 million people off of welfare, including 7.5 million off of food stamps. And that's a great thing. That's a great thing. Among African American workers, the largest share drops below the poverty line. That's a great thing. African American poverty fell for the first time in nearly 31 years, and the largest share gains from the recession or the recession completely. Who would think there's that? Incredible. Total poverty for African Americans has reached the lowest level in nearly 31 years. For Hispanic Americans, the largest share drops below the poverty line. That's a great thing. In the first three years, we lifted 6.5 million people off of food stamps. Think of that. That's a great thing. We're delighted to report that among Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Pacific Islanders, the share that's fallen the most is African American. Another great thing. Another great thing. Fully half of all new entrepreneurs are African American. I love African American. I think they're incredible. I love them. I think they're the most incredible human beings. Anybody, really. I love all of them. We have thousands of people. I mean, honestly, it's a crazy diversity. I hate to even mention one, but I'm just saying there are so many. I know it's a very small minority, but they're incredible. And you know what, if you look at any one of these cities, from the standpoint of the African American community, from the standpoint of the Asian American community, from the standpoint of the Hispanic American community, they're incredible. It's a great time to be an entrepreneur. It's a great time to be an entrepreneur. So thank you, and I want to thank the people of Baltimore. You have a lot of great people. In the African American community, we launched the largest investment in the United States African American military yet. We've invested more than $2 billion into the African American military, and we will soon be finishing it. Think of that. Soon we're getting our act together. We've done so much. We've invested more than 2 billion dollars. It's been a long time. It's a long time. We have to rebuild our military. It's like a beautiful thing. When you see the way our country is going, when you see the way we're going, you just can't help but be enthusiastic about it. It's like the greatest comeback. You know, if you go back a certain distance in time, from our standpoint, the last three years, not even close. It's been three years. I don't think we've had anything like that. I think the fake news media, the fake reporters, they went out to, like Woodward. Like Woodward. They went out and bought his book. They bought his book. It's going back bestseller. Bestseller.

And they'll say, \"What a lousy president he is.\" And if I don't win, they're going to say, \"What a lame president he is.\" LIDDEEP. LIDDEEP. I see him in Iowa. I see him all over. In New Hampshire, he's even worse. I've never seen it. He's got one eye on Trump. He's got one and a half, two eyes on Trump. He's got one and a half, two eyes on Trump. That's not so good. I think he's got one or two. That's not so good. I think he's got one, two, or three. Not so good. But he's serious. He said, \"We're going to eliminate religion from public life.\" That's what he meant by that. Now, the great state of New Mexico has the highest murder rate in the country. You know that, right? The state has the highest. I don't know if you know that. It's hard to get a grip on what's going on. Hard to get a grip. But there's no margin like this. It's a big thing. It's a big thing. And that's why I got so angry at the way the Democrats were running the country. I thought that was the end of it. That was the end of the Bernie Sanders phenomenon. That was a big thing. But now we're going to turn it around. We're going to turn it around. We're going to turn it around fast. We're going to turn it around quickly. Today, the New York Times ran a front page story about how badly off the economy is in certain communities. And it was just terrible. I mean, you know, we're talking about a subject that's just really horrible, right? The subject of our past. It's the subject of our past. We have to bring it up. It's just the beginning. There's much more to come. There's much more to come. Racial Profiling. How about that? That's another beauty. They want to go back. I mean, look at this. I'm all for it, but you know what? You know what? I don't want them to go back. I don't want them to go back to select cities, sending them to entire neighborhoods, entire communities. I don't want that. I think it's terrible. I think it's terrible. They should keep it open. They should keep it open. But do we want to just keep it that way? I don't think so. I don't think so. I mean, if you want to end it, that's fine. But do we want to just keep it that way? I don't think so. Keep it open. Democrats up today called for a shutdown. Republicans said we want a shutdown. We want a shutdown. And by the way, the vote was 53 to 4, think of that. That's a lot. That's a lot of votes. Republicans, at least we have a majority of the votes, we have a majority of the votes. Because you have Democrats, they don't like the fact that we have a majority of the votes. So we won Wisconsin. We won Michigan. We won Pennsylvania. We won North Carolina. We won South Carolina. We won Florida. And we're doing a good job, but I'm not going to call it anything, because we're far enough along that I can call it anything. And we're doing a good job even though I don't like the subject, racial profiling. I don't think you're done yet. I think you have another four years, possibly if the Republicans get in, we have to close it up. Because we're doing a good job. We're treating our African-Americans fairly. We're treating our Asian-Americans fairly. We're treating our Hispanic-Americans fairly. We're treating our alcoholics fairly. And we're treating our veterans\n",
            "[–] from \"The Secretary General of the United States of America.\" Hello, Secretary General. It's a great honor to be with you in a state that's so important to me. It's state of Iowa. It's a great honor to be with you. Thank you. And just quickly, we have great crowds all over the place. Last night, we set a record. It was the biggest crowd we've ever had in the history of a big arena. It was a record. It was a mass. It outnumbers … It outnumbers all other crowds. By the way, do you know what's … Is it bigger than this? You know what? It's bigger than this. I mean, how could be big? Look at this. How could it possibly be? They're taking it from here to … How do you turn this? They're going to turn this into a debate. They're going to turn this into a debate. They're going to turn this into a debate. They're going to say, \"How dare you say this? These crowds are so big.\" This is what crowds are like. You know what? They're like this. They're going to have like 200,000 people in a stadium. We have like 500, maybe a thousand. I never saw anything like it. I think there's like 500, maybe a thousand people outside. But that's a lot. That's a big arena. Thank you. I appreciate it. And that's all you hear. Not all of it. You know what? I appreciate it more now because I can say, \"Thank you very much that the arenas can hold 50,000 people.\" I hear that from the arenas. I hear that from the arenas. But I appreciate it more because you know what? I appreciate it more because now I can say, \"Thank you very much that you can seat this crowd.\" I can say that. I can't say it. I'll always say, \"The arenas can hold 500, but I'm telling you, that's the hard part.\" I have to work my ass off in the gymnasium or the weight room. I don't get any water. I don't get any food. I don't get any air. It's like a prison. I can't do it. That's my problem. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't even imagine it. You know, you can't do it sitting. You can't do it. So I have to work my ass off. You know, for three days, I think it was maybe about noon, when we got in because of China, we had to work our asses off. That's what it's about. That's what it's about. I'll tell you what. You come to think of it, you would have to say that's pretty damn good. You come to think of it, you would have to say that's pretty damn good. You know what? We've set 141 records on the stock market, highest levels in the history of our country. 141 records. That means, for 15 years, the stock market reached an all time high. Think of it, for 15 years, for the entire life of our country, it's going to be … Think of it, for 15 years, the stock market has gone up 141 times. For the people that work for me, that's their 401k. It's going up very big. And by the way, the people that work for me, their 401k are doing very well. That's very good. That's very good. The people that work for me, their 401ks are doing very well. That's very good. And your wife or your husband says, \"Darling, I love you so much. You've always been a conservative person. But now you're doing the right thing.\" Right? We're fighting for your family. We're fighting for your job. I'm fighting for your family. And we're fighting for your country. And you know what? You do it every single day. You know, when I go to China, I go to India. I go to Russia. I go to all these other places. I see all these beautiful Chinese take off the boats. I see their boats. I have friends that come into the country, they have no idea where they're going. They never know where they're going. I know China, and I know India well. We do it a little bit, but we've done it for many years, for decades, for decades. And now it's time. You see it. You see it. You know, it's not like they came here for nothing. It's not like they came here for nothing. They came here for a lot of money. They wanted to build a wall. I said, \"What's the point? We don't want a wall.\" I want a wall. But we're building it.\n",

In this room is a special person, you know that, right? Special. She's been a great help to me, as have all of the people here. Special. She's been a great help. Cindy Hyde-Smith. Her incredible kindness and her love and her commitment to helping people in every community is what made me the great, great, presidential candidate. We love Cindy. She's a special person. She's a fighter. She's a tough cookie. She's a star. She's going to be a future star. We're going to have a lot of future stars. Come on up. Come on up. Just come up. We want to thank you, Cindy. We want to thank you. And a man who's a friend of mine who's just got elected, you know that, right? He's going to be a great, you know that? You're going to have a great baseball player. You're going to have a great, great player. We're going to have a lot of future stars. You know that, right? We're supporting our players, whether it's the players themselves, whether it's the players that are here tonight or coming back next week. We want to thank you very much. Very much. Thank you. We'll see you all over the country. We're supporting our amazing heroes of law enforcement. Tonight, we're also joined by two terrific new state senators who are joining our great congressional delegation. You know, two terrific new members of Congress, both coming from the great state of South Carolina, right? Representatives Scott and Leonard. Thank you, Scott. Thank you, Leonard. Congressman Mark Meadows is joining us. Thank you, Mark. We're also joined tonight by somebody we've been very, very complimentary of all the way back there, Matt Schlatt. He is a winner. He is a winner. He's a winner. You know, Matt just won, like so many of you, like so many of you came from a small town, and it meant a great deal when you win. You win all the way back home. It's a great deal. It's a great deal. I want to just thank you both for being here. I want to especially thank you for the incredible job you've done in South Carolina. There's tremendous talent out there. Out of all of these states, I mean, it's the state with the greatest talent. Out of all of these states, and you're winning, and you're doing well, I can tell you that. You're doing well. Right? You're doing well. Thank you very much.

We will hire more police, increase penalties for assault on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities, and ban sanctuary cities. We will elect a\n",
            "After years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. We are finally putting America first. We take care of our own. And I'll tell you, it's not about me. It's about you. It's about your family. It's about your future. And it's about the fate of our nation. And right now, it's about the fate of our nation. We are finally putting America first. No issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than the issue of immigration. Before I came into office, the far left's policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country, poisoning our children, including right here in a very big way. The great state of Nevada. Washington Democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of American citizens. You know that, you've been complaining about it for a long time. It's one of the reasons you voted for Trump. They want to let anyone from around the world simply walk across the border. Then they want to give them a lifetime of free welfare, of healthcare, of lots of other things, including education. All paid for by the taxpayers of the United States. Illegal immigration costs Nevada businesses and families $1.4 billion every year, over $1,500 per household. For the average family, that's a lot of money. For the first time in history, median household income is now more than twice what it was in 2007. Think of that. It's one of the reasons that as the world is not doing great, the stock market's not doing great, and you're not going to have your 401k's grow quite like they did. That's not happening anymore. It's really not happening. America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the last election. One of the great paradoxes of our lives is that we are now working with China again. I said that I is going to invest a lot of money. We want to let them know about it. We want to let them know about the importance of a strong military. We want to let them know that if they want to invest a lot of money, we are very happy indeed. It's very possible that we will be expanding our military budget by a lot. We will be doing that very soon. Before I took office, our military was depleted. It's now more depleted than at any time in the history of our country. We will be investing a lot of money. We will be doing that very rapidly. You'll be seeing that in very short order. While the extreme left has been wasting America's time with vial hoaxes, we've been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed, right? We added another 225,000 new jobs last month alone. Amazing. And I will say this, when I first started, they were saying that China was leaving the country. Okay? They were saying that for many, many years, for decades, for decades, they were saying that China was leaving their country. And I said, \"Well, guess what? They're not leaving China. They're staying put.\" You know that? That's not happening anymore. I can't believe it. That's not happening anymore. I applaud and say a lot of things in my life have been less exciting or thrilling than watching my administration kill the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdad. And we now have the number one terrorist group in the world, and we have a tremendous support in the military, just remarkable. They're not happy. The military, the military doesn't want to be where you are. They want to be where it is. That's where it's at. We're doing an unbelievable job of keeping North Korea happy. We put a lot of pressure on North Korea, but they didn't want to pay. They didn't want to pay. Now they're happy, and that's good. That's good. They don't want to pay. They're sending a signal to the rest of the world, to the rest of the world, you know that? That's what it is. They're sending a great signal. Now, I don't want to give away any classified information, okay? Just relax. But you know what? They're not happy. They're not happy. You saw the one after the election. I called him an animal the other day. He called me an animal. He said, \"You're president. You're not president.\" I said, \"No, he's not.\" I'll tell you, he's more fun to watch. But that's another story. But we've done tremendous job keeping North Korea happy. In fact, the stock market. So when I banned China from coming in, the Chinese immediately closed, as did Europe. Remember Obama would go in, as did Marco. A lot of people say to me, \"What happened? Why\n",

It's going to be up much greater than it was before because we're investing in our nation. We're investing in our nation. The United States is now respected again. For years you had the worst foreign policy. You had the worst foreign policy of all time. And now you have the best foreign policy of all time. Does that make sense? You know what it is? We are now respected again. People can talk and talk about the Middle East forever. And then they say, \"Trump is no longer respected.\" I mean, we're not going to do that. We're not going to do that. We're not going to do that. We're not going to do that. We're going to be replacing the NAFTA disaster with the US, Mexico, Canada agreement very soon. A very strong, very strong agreement. Going to be very strong. Going to be very strong. And you only hear about that from the fake news. You don't hear about that from the real news. That's why we have such strong […]. We have taken back control of America's borders. We stopped the tide of people that were pouring across our borders. We stopped the horrible, you know, we're not going to comment on that, but we're keeping the wall. We're building it. We're building it. And we're looking at a lot of different things. Mexico is going to be very tough. They've had 27,000 soldiers on our border. And of course, the Democrats don't want that wall. They want open borders. They want people to come pour into our country. And of course, the Democrats do not want that wall. It's one of the reasons we won so easily. It was one of the reasons we won. But now we're building the wall. It's going up rapidly. And you know, at the end of this, it'll be finished. We'll have something really terrific. And it's under contract for now. It's going up rapidly. And you know, the Democrats don't want that wall. They want people to come pour into our country. And of course, the Democrats do not want that wall. It's one of the reasons we won so easily. It was one of the reasons we won. But now we have a great, strong, beautiful wall. And I want to thank Mexico because you know, the Democrats were for the wall, okay? They thought it was a terrible idea. Democrats want open borders. And we want people to come pour in. And of course, the Democrats also want unmanned drones flying around, taking pictures of everybody. I don't think so. At least with me, they don't want that wall. You know, the wall is under contract for now. It's going up. We'll be finished with it very quickly. Very quickly. Tomorrow we'll sign a terrific new trade agreement with China that's a step in the right direction. We're also aggressively combating the opioid epidemic and we've done great … Since I took office, the number of drug overdose deaths … Last year, it's down by 25% since May. Could you believe it?

Remember, she took a little sinker, but you know what? It was worth it because we won. Those are the only two things I can think of. One is much bigger, much better, much more beautiful, and it's always, \"Have you seen that skunk? That's a Senator.\" The other is a real beauty. I don't know, she's a real beauty.

We're also working to reduce the cost of childcare. We've reduced the cost of child care, for 60 million American families. I said that, Dana, earlier this year, and it was stated that collectively, child care is costing the government almost as much as healthcare. You know that, Dana, right? They're not kidding. It's crazy. And yet, none of the candidates have said how much it's costing. It's costing the government more. It's not working. We've reduced health insurance premiums, the cost of prescription drugs, the cost of a lot of different things. We've done a job with it. We're looking at it very seriously. We're looking at it very seriously. And the drug companies are spending a fortune because they don't want people to go without. They know that. Yesterday\n",

And it's being investigated. They're trying to, oh, what a mess. They're trying to figure this one out. It's a mess. No, it's a mess. Does that make sense? You have to understand they're trying to figure it out. That's the first layer. I mean, it's not every one of them. You have to give Phil a break. He's a tough guy. He's a smart guy.

Phil is going to hire the plane. They make it so it's like, I'm not a good pilot. I can't do it. I can't do it. It's a mess. They can't wrap their minds around that one. It's so simple. It's so simple. They take the pilot. They hire the private pilot. Bill Clinton can't wrap his mind around that one either. Bill, you're a great guy. Tell me about it. About your family. About your grandchildren. They're good people. They have a great family. They had a very, very special day, a very special day in the history of our country. They have a great day. They have a great day. To protect the health and safety of our citizens, we awarded $100 million to improve water infrastructure in Flint. How badly was Flint? Who were the geniuses that did that to you? You have clean water coming into Flint. They had to pay a very tiny little fee. So instead, they go into this horrible, horrible, really polluted water and the water comes out of there. They spend hundreds of millions of dollars to save like a couple of bucks, and the water was so terrible and it hurt the people. It hurt the people. But we're getting it fixed.

Now it's the most vibrant space center in the world, by far. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools.

I'm going to put sanctions all over the place. And then it became, \"Okay. That's a good thing.\" Now the Ukraine deal is moving along well. They cut a deal with Russia. How's that? Why's that? You know what they say? Democrats for Trump. That's what it is. Democrats for Trump. That's what it is. They want to erase your borders and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in school. And sadly, many local governments have already done that. Sadly, many local governments have already done that. We could end it immediately. We could end it immediately. But the Democrats keep on trying to overturn the last election. They want to destroy our suburbs. You know that. Barack Obama destroyed suburbs. He concentrated wealth in the suburbs. My father said, \"If you don't like our suburbs, don't move to the suburbs. Don't move. Move to the suburbs.\" He wanted to build highrises in the suburbs. Right? Highrises. Remember the issue? They want to build highrises in the suburbs. I said, \"Does that mean moving to the suburbs? That's the problem.\" They want to build highrises in the suburbs. You know what? If you don't like our suburbs, you'd be fine. The suburbs are a very suburban place. You're not going to have highrises. But they want to destroy the suburbs. They want to take away your guns. They want to take away your religion. They want to bring back internment. They want to indoctrinate your children and they want to destroy your borders. They want toide. They want toend your immigration laws. They want toend your safety. They want toend your borders. Sanctuary city policies are designed to drive up costs at every turn. Drive up costs. We've ended catch and release. You know what catch and release is? You catch somebody, say, \"Could you please give us your name and phone number?\" \"Oh, ok. My number's … \" And they release them. They release them. And we could end it so easily. It's one of those things. But what they want to do is drive up the cost of housing. You know, we have a great … in New York, it's really … it's one of the reasons we have such high crime. It's really one of the reasons. Gangs. They're spread out. They don't … it's one of the things, they like to mix it up. They like to mix it up. They were actually, they were in the suburbs. And they said, \"Oh, this is terrible. This is terrible.\" They're not spread out. They're strong, they're smart, they're tough people. Gangs. They're killers. They're vicious people. But you know what? They said, \"No, it's terrible. These are wonderful people.\" And they embraced the change. They embraced it like almost immediately. It was like in a very short period of time. There's like a wave of people, and they hug and embrace and kiss. It's like magic. And then they walk away. They like to do it often. They like to mix it up. Barack Obama would walk away. And he would probably be gone a long way. Someday he'd be gone. But they embrace him and they kiss. It's great. It's great. But we're building it again. We're building our military again. We're rebuilding our military. And we did it in a very short period of time. It took a long time, but we got it done. We're building Space Force. The wall is going up like never before. And we will soon be rebuilding the entire US military. And I want to thank all of our great Mexican soldiers. They've done a great job. You know, the wall is over a hundred miles long. You think that was easy? That was not easy. That was not easy. I went there with the wife of a fallen soldier and we sat for hours and days and weeks and months and years. They knew what was happening. They saw what was happening. They saw the terrible things happening. And they did the right thing. They went there, they met with their families and they got a proper burial. They got a proper burial. And they were celebrated and they were proud. They were proud that we are doing well with the wall. And in all fairness, they are our neighbors. We love and appreciate them, but they've done a great job. That's what you want. They want it for their communities\n",
            "If you want to keep your doctor, if you want to keep your plan, if you want to keep your doctor and your plan, you're going to have to sign something very nasty. You're going to have a choice. You're going to keep your doctor, you're going to have to keep your plan. But if you want to really drain the swamp, if you want to really drain the swamp, first you have to vote Republican. Because the Democrat party is run by left wing extremists who want to massively raise your taxes, increase regulations, cancel your health plans, raid Medicare, shut down American energy, destroy your social security, they're going to destroy your social security, eliminate religious liberty, punish free speech, confiscate your guns, abolish your borders, and indoctrinate America's children with hateful, left-wing ideology. Other than that, they want to have you believe in things that are just as bad. For instance, they want to abolish cash bail. Where you can get 10 times more money for the crime of stealing a car. You know that, right? They want to end cash bail. In Chicago, an illegal alien was arrested for brutally stabbing a woman to death. In Portland, officers captured a previously deported MS-13 gang member who shot a woman to death. And in Dallas, an illegal alien was arrested for repeatedly raping a young children, 13-year-old girls. How about that? They want to disarm law abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members. In the city of Seattle, officers captured a previously deported criminal alien charged with multiple sex crimes, including rape, kidnapping, and sodomy. They release him and he goes on to commit a horrific sex crime. I mean, we don't want people coming in. We want people to our country. We want people to our country. These are animal crimes and they should be brought back. Should be brought back. They're being brought back by the thousands. They're being brought back by the thousands. They're seriously ill people. And we should bring them back. Because the Democrats don't want them. You know, they'll say, \"Come in. We want people to come in.\" They'll say, \"Come in. We want people to come in.\" But they don't want them. Democrats don't want them. It's like, let's go to Italy. We want to go to Italy. They won't accept it. It's like they don't want it. Republicans will continue to enact new trade deals that create jobs and strengthen our communities. They strengthen our communities. The worst deal of all is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP. And our country is not happy with that. Not happy. In fact, at stake in this election is the survival of the American nation. Does anybody honestly think that this country is going to survive? This is the most important election in the history of our country. Think of it. Think of it. And without us, you wouldn't have a thing. That's what they want. They want to take it away from you. The zombie apocalypse, if you want to watch it, you've got it. But we're going to be putting it up against other, much bigger, badder, badder, more horrific threats. And we're going to be taking care of it. Because we're doing things that nobody's ever done before. Going to be taking care of it very shortly, indeed, very shortly after we're inaugurated. Biden's agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in the USA. That's what it is. For the last four years, I've been delivering for our incredible Hispanic community, I'm just returning today after four years. I love this community. They want people to come in. I can't say it. I don't know. I can't say it. I don't know it. I think you know it. They want people to come in, but they want people to come in through merit, right? And we've achieved more than any administration in the history of our country, not even close. We've achieved more than any previous administration, not even close. Because we're bringing it back from the dead. Democrats want open borders. They want sanctuary cities. They want to give illegal aliens government healthcare, free education, more advantages than our own citizens have and more benefits than our own military gets. In the vicious cycle, every Democrat running for president supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up until the moment of birth. That is why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, and they want to give illegal aliens more advantages than our own citizens have. They want to give more to illegal aliens than we give to our own military. Does anybody know that? You know why? Because they want to\n"
